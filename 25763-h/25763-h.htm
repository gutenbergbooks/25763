<h2>I</h2>

<p>Yes. He was born in the first week of
June, in the year 1906. Quite a short
while ago, as you see&mdash;that is, as we men
count time&mdash;but long enough, just as a
child&#8217;s life is occasionally long enough,
to affect the lives&mdash;ay, more, the characters&mdash;of
some who claimed to be his betters
on this present earth, with certainties
in some dim and distant heaven that
might or might not have a corner here
or there for dogs.
</p>
<p>His parentage was that of a royal
house in purity of strain and length of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
pedigree, and he first saw the light in the
yard of a mill upon the river, where the
old wheel had groaned for generations
or dripped in silence, according as the
water rose or fell, and corn came in to be
ground.
</p>
<p>There were others like him in appearance
in the yard; on the eyot on which
the mill-buildings stood, gorgeous in
many-coloured tiles; round the dwelling-house,
or in a large wired enclosure close
by. His master, the Over-Lord, bred
dogs of his kind for the nonce, not necessarily
for profit, but because, with a
great heart for dogs, he chose to, claiming
indeed the proud boast that not a
single dog of his class walked these Islands
that was not of his strain&mdash;and
claiming that, moreover, truly.
</p>
<p>At one period there might have been
counted, in and around this mill-yard, no
less than thirty-eight dogs, young and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
middle-aged, and all more or less closely
related. But while this number was
much above the average, the congestion
that arose thereby was chargeable with
the single unhappy episode in Murphy&#8217;s
life, concerning which he often spoke to
me in after days, and the effect of which
he carried to the end. Of this, however,
more later.
</p>
<p>Life in the midst of such a company&mdash;Irishmen
all&mdash;necessarily meant a more
or less rough-and-tumble existence,
where the strongest had the best of it, and
the weaker ones were knocked out, when
the Master was not there to interfere.
Each one had to find his own level by
such means as he could, and thus this
great company, or school, of dogs resembled
in many particulars those other
schools to which We are sent Ourselves,
or send those other sons of Ours. The
training to be got here, as elsewhere, developed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
primarily, indeed, and all unconsciously,
the first and greatest of requisites
in life, whether for dog or man.
And if, in some instances, evil characteristics,
such as combativeness, selfishness,
and the habit of bad language, became
accentuated, in spite of the stern discipline
of the place, their opposites&mdash;good
temper, a light and happy disposition,
and a civil tongue&mdash;received their meed
of recognition even from the bigger fellows,
like Pagan I. or II., or that Captain
of the School, often spoken of with
bated breath&mdash;Postman, Murphy&#8217;s
father, mated afterwards to the great
beauty, Barbara, both being of the bluest
of blue blood.
</p>
<p>The young were taught their place,
and that further quality, now dropping
out of fashion&mdash;how to keep it. Or each
one had a lesson in yet another virtue,
still more out of date, being judged no
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
longer necessary or becoming in this very
modern world, and as only showing a
silly deference if exhibited at all. Respect
was, in truth, the chief of all virtues
here inculcated&mdash;respect for age,
for old dogs are no longer to be challenged;
respect for strength and the great
unwritten laws; respect for sex; respect
for those who had shown themselves to
be the better men; respect for such as
neither fought nor swore but held their
own by character alone.
</p>
<p>It was, for instance, not correct for the
young to approach the older members of
the school and claim equality, for,
strange as it may seem, equality had no
place here, save that all were dogs. Nor
when a bigger fellow had a bone, won,
earned, or come by of his own enterprise,
was it deemed fitting that the young
should do more than watch at respectful
distance, with ears drooped and envy
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
curbed as well as might be. By such
methods the meaning of the sacredness of
property was taught; and also, that without
due regard to this last there could be
security for no one, or for anything that
he might own.
</p>
<p>True, some of this company here, suffering
from swelled-head, the harebrained
impetuosity of youth, or judging
that to them alone had been bequeathed
the secret of all requisite reforms, advanced
theories of their own composing.
Of course they found adherents, especially
when gain was scented, for to profit
at another&#8217;s expense is not unpopular, in
some directions, from the top to the bottom
of the world. But, as a rule, these
theories were not long-lived. The company,
so to speak, found themselves, and
the innate good sense they claimed to
have came to their aid, before the whole
school was set generally by the ears, or
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
the Over-Lord was called upon to interfere.
</p>
<p>Thus, where a fellow&#8217;s own was concerned
the cry with the really honest was,
&#8220;Hands off, there!&#8221;&mdash;blood being rightly
spilt, if necessary, in defence thereof, as
it always will be, till the last of dogs and
men lie down and die. Of course if one
or other left his own unguarded, or,
overcome by plethora, fell asleep, or
grew fat and careless, then another of
his standing came and took that property
away. In such an event, he who had lost
could do no more than whimper cur-like,
while those lying round the yard
would look up to see what the shindy was
about, and then quietly remark, &#8220;<i>That&#8217;s</i>
as it should be.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then again, when, on a sultry afternoon
in this first summer of Murphy&#8217;s
life, some older members of the family
betook themselves to such cool places on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
the eyot as the shadows cast by the wide
eaves of the mill, it was ordered they
were to be left in peace and not plagued
by younger folk, however good-natured
they might be. Nor were others to be
followed when they stole away to the
opening of the mill-race&mdash;where the
water came out at speed, brown and
foaming, from the dark shadows under
the floors&mdash;to listen, maybe, half asleep,
to the great wheel groaning its solemn
music, as the dripping green paddles
threw off a cool mist to refresh the jaded
air.
</p>
<p>However strange such a choice might
seem to those of restless spirit, it was not
more so than that of others who, careless
of themselves, preferred a hole in the
dust of the upper yard among the Buff
Orpingtons, and the grilling heat of the
midsummer sun. There must be differences
of taste here as elsewhere. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
spot chosen must be respected, not only
because it was the home for the time,
however short, but also because here was
privacy, and it was not right that such
should be at any time invaded, if rightly
and obviously sought&mdash;at least, so was it
judged by those who inhabited the island
at this period.
</p>
<p>That Murphy noticed all these things
goes without saying. He kept them
mostly to himself, after the manner of his
kind; but he watched nevertheless
closely, his black eyebrows moving continually
just above his eyes, as he lay in
the rough grass in the shade of the pollard
willows, or beneath the whispering
aspens.
</p>
<p>At this time he had not long emerged
from the limp stage, when hind-quarters
would continually give way, and there
was nothing to be done but rest on one
haunch and try to look wise, being continually
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
bothered by the flies. After a
while he began to grow stronger and
more comely, his ears darkened, and his
eyes&mdash;put in, as they say, with a dirty
thumb&mdash;grew larger, taking on that exceeding
brightness that made passers-by
look and look again. He was also allowed
further afield when his turn came.
There were walks along the river-banks,
in company with half-a-dozen of the
others; and before he was six months old
he could run a good distance with a
horse and trap, ere he would come to the
step and look up with a laugh, saying,
&#8220;Here, take me up; I&#8217;m blown!&#8221; The
old horse in the shafts knew the ways of
the dogs well, and would shorten his
pace, and indeed pull up altogether, if
a thoughtless one was likely to be injured.
It was probably from this that
Murphy suffered all his life from a mistaken
notion that it was the duty of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
horses, as well as drivers of all kinds, to
get out of his way, and not he necessarily
out of theirs.
</p>
<p>It was a happy life in a land of happiness
and freedom, though discipline was
stern, and all had to pass their period of
training. Sooner or later each one was
judged upon his merits, as well by his
comrades as by the great, tall Over-Lord,
to whom primarily they owed allegiance.
And if such judgment was occasionally
fallacious, as it frequently is, the world
over, when based upon such points alone,
it worked out fairly when the time arrived
for an estimate to be made of the
character that every one here was entitled
to&mdash;when the first home had to be
left behind, and the world faced in town
or country, up or down the greater river
of a common life.
</p>
<p>For such a temperament as Murphy&#8217;s,
a life like this was happiness itself. He
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
was sociable, and loved company intensely,
though preferably the company
of Man. Solitude he abhorred; games
were his delight; for killing things, even
were it a rat from one of the thousand
holes he met with when walking by the
river, he never cared, and indeed appeared
never quite to understand. &#8220;Live
and let live&#8221; was his motto, while playing
always the game of &#8220;catch-who-catch-can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was no reason to bring pain into
the field at all. Life to him was a condition
full of smiles, or to be made so,
though there was snarling round the
corner, as well as folk of difficult temperament
to remain puzzlers to the end.
Those about, therefore, were to be reckoned
friends, and to be met in such way
as better dogs themselves lay down.
Their society obviously had its rules,
which, if occasionally broken, were yet
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
to be known and recognised, just as they
themselves, though dogs, were able to
discern that the members of that other
society, on to which they were apparently
grafted, had theirs.
</p>
<p>These last and they themselves were
nothing less than partners&mdash;so it seemed
to him&mdash;in a great game, to be played
always in good heart and with the spirit
of true sportsmanship. Both moved according
to law, the only difference between
the two being that Men held the
power of the Veto&mdash;and exercised it too
often, he would add in his perfect, well-bred
manner, in a way that declared
their ignorance. Men, he averred,
would always insist on assuming that
their laws were right at all times, and,
furthermore, were always applicable to
dogs, forgetting that, more often even
than themselves, dogs were moved by
laws imperious.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></p>
<p>Had he been as the majority of dogs,
he would, when such thoughts occupied
his brain, have joined no doubt unhesitatingly
in Puck&#8217;s song&mdash;
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin: 0 auto 0 ; '><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;Lord, what fools these mortals be!&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>But, then, this is where he differed from
that majority. Man was his friend.
Friendship meant loyalty, and loyalty
should be unstained.
</p>
<p>There was much in what he said. On
many an occasion a dog will show that
he knows better than a man, and can
do things that transcend Man&#8217;s boasted
powers. We all know that&mdash;or should
do so&mdash;for the moment may arrive when
we find ourselves dependent on the judgment
of a dog. To fail to recognise it
then is to create difficulties and to blunder
badly, causing the most tractable of
our friends to look up with a puzzled expression
in their eyes, and the more
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
head-strong and outspoken to go ahead, with
this sentence, flung back over the shoulder&mdash;&#8220;<i>You
fools, you; when will you understand!</i>&#8221;
</p>
<p>And the fun of it all is that Man with
his self-assurance, and that limited vision
of his of which he seems sometimes completely
unaware, thinks that he is training
the dog, whereas the dog is perfectly capable,
as will be shown, of at least in
some directions training him. Thus,
where differences arise, Man jumps to
his conclusions and claims his prerogative.
It is a sorry business when an all-too-hasty
punishment follows, as it often
does, for Man&mdash;so Murphy used to say&mdash;would
find himself very frequently to be
wrong. But then Murphy, when he
talked like this in the after days, showing
how easily We might make mistakes,
and explaining so much that was not
wholly realised before, caused sundry
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
folk to wonder whether in some previous
life he had in his spare time studied
Bentham. For dogs or men to make
mistakes is not necessarily for them to do
wrong. &#8220;To trace errors to their source
is often to refute them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He often quoted that; but on the only
occasion on which he was asked about his
previous studies he remained silent. He
and his Master were sitting on the hillside,
far away from the hum of men&mdash;as,
in fact, they mostly were. His eyes were
ranging over the valley to the skyline.
&#8220;That&#8217;s the way to look, my dear master,&#8221;
he appeared to be saying&mdash;&#8220;that&#8217;s
the way to look. Never run heel way.
For you and me there is a future. Look
ahead, and cast forward; never look behind!&#8221;
</p>
<p>His remarks often, in this way, touched
lightly on great questions.
</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
<h2>II</h2>
</div>

<p>To look ahead in the hey-day of youth is
to look forward to unclouded happiness.
And, no doubt, to Murphy and those of
his own age, the fact that the summer
waned and that autumn followed, when
leaves fell mysteriously from the trees
and there were sporting scents in the air,
made little difference to their outlook.
Happiness had no relation to the seasons:
they were all good in their turn. Jolly
times ranged from spring to winter.
And, perhaps, winter after all was best.
</p>
<p>It was on a winter day, in fact, that
Murphy first made a mark in the mind
of his Over-Lord, and it came about like
this.
</p>
<p>The day before had been typical of
late January. The sun had not shone
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
since daybreak. The sky to the north
was lead colour, and the wind was blowing
through snow. If it froze on the
north side of the hedgerows, it thawed
on the south&mdash;the coldest condition of
all.
</p>
<p>There were covered places for the
dogs of the mill, with plenty of straw,
and when one or two who had been out
for a walk came in and said there would
be snow before another morning dawned,
those who heard the remark curled
themselves tighter or drew closer to their
more intimate friends. And as they
slept and woke, and slept again, they saw
the lights go out one by one, save those
in the mill itself, for barges had come
with loads of grain, and the mill was
working all night. They could hear the
steady &#8220;throb,&#8221; &#8220;throb&#8221; of the great mill-wheel
and the plash of the distant
waters; but just before the new dawn
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
these sounds gave way to a hum that
played a muffled music in the trees. The
men&#8217;s footsteps never sounded at all, till
they were close at hand; and then the
mill slowly stopped as though tired, and
silence reigned supreme in the cold.
Dogs and men slept firmly for a little:
Nature was at work putting a new face
upon the world.
</p>
<p>And after all that there followed the
joyousness of a cloudless morning, as the
stars faded out, and the pale sun lit up
a world that was now pure white. Snow
lay everywhere to the depth of three
inches&mdash;not more&mdash;for it had spread itself
evenly in the stillness, and covered
the ground, and the roofs, and the barges
that had come with the grain, making
everything look strange, even to the waters
that were licking the banks, and that
somehow or other had turned the colour
of green bottle-glass.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span></p>
<p>Then, by-and-by, came the Over-Lord,
and called this name and that; and the
last that he called was &#8220;Murphy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Here were games indeed! Here was
something new to play with; to be
skipped and rolled and gambolled in to
heart&#8217;s content; to be even bitten at, and
swallowed till forbidden. Why, this
new material that the younger ones had
never seen before called even the limpest
to forget his limpness, as though new
blood flowed in his veins and he were endowed
with a new life!
</p>
<p>They were soon out of the yard, and
away down the lane. And then the
Over-Lord turned into the fields and
struck a right-of-way that led in direction
of a hamlet two miles distant. Here
many of the meadows were thirty acres
and over in extent, flat as any floor, with
great elm trees in their hedgerows.
They were untenanted now by sheep or
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
cattle, for these had been driven off the
night before to higher ground, by men
who kept an eye upon the weather. The
virgin surface of the snow lay glittering
gold and silver in the early morning sun,
with here and there, as a contrast, the
long shadows of the limbs of a great oak
or elm, cast as though some one had
traced its pattern for fun with a brushful
of the purest cobalt.
</p>
<p>There were only five dogs out that
morning. Three were now fastened to a
leash; one other was very old, and he and
Murphy were allowed what latitude they
liked. So presently it chanced that
Murphy found himself some way from
the rest, and suddenly called upon to
show what he could do. As he went, he
came upon a slight rise in the snow, as
though something lay beneath. The
more experienced would have known
what that was, for their noses would have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
told them in a trice. When snow falls
and a hare finds itself being gradually
covered by the flakes, it does what it can
to bury itself deeper; but always with
this eye on life&mdash;that it assiduously keeps
a hole open that it may breathe, and always
to the leeward. Such is one of
many evidences of clever instinct to be
met with for ever in the fields.
</p>
<p>Thus, before this young dog knew well
what had happened, there sprang, as if
by magic, from the snow a beauteous animal,
strong of scent and fleet of foot, and
heading straight away from him at top
speed.
</p>
<p>He heard a voice calling many names,
and at the same time the crack of a whip.
But his name was not among the rest;
and he just had time to notice that the
Over-Lord stood still, with the other
dogs about him. Then he was off in pursuit,
straight as a line for the river.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
There the hare made its first turn, Murphy
being twenty yards in rear. He
was running mute now, and both hare
and dog were settling to their work&mdash;the
one to escape if it could, the
other to catch, if so it might be. They
were through the far fence a moment
later, and disappeared, only, however,
quickly to return and take a line straight
down this thirty-acre piece. It was a
stretch of nearly a quarter of a mile, and
ere they reached the further fence Murphy
was gaining ground. The hare
doubled at the boundary, and then
doubled again, making the figure of a
giant eight on the glittering golden surface
of the snow.
</p>
<p>Was the dog really gaining? It was a
fine course. The hare was evidently a
late leveret of the previous season; the
dog was scarcely more than seven months
old. How would it end? The Over-Lord
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
stood and watched, determined
that none should interfere. There
should be fair play in a fair field, if he
could only keep a grip upon these others
that were whimpering and shivering and
straining at the leash. He had passed
the thong of his whip through the collar
of the old dog, so all were really well
within control.
</p>
<p>Would the young dog last? That was
the crucial question. The hare had had
many a run before this to save her skin,
and was hardened by the life of the
breezy downs and the wide fields. But
the dog had never previously been tried
in such a way: his life had been more or
less an artificial one, and he had never
been called upon to lay himself out, or
been put to such a strain as these almost
maddening moments entailed. Catch
this thing somehow he must. Were not
his comrades looking on? Did not the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
very silence of the Over-Lord seem to
demand of him his very best? There
appeared, however, to be no getting level
with this animal of surprising fleetness of
foot, that seemed to glide over the
ground with perfect ease, and that responded
gamely to every effort that he
made.
</p>
<p>The group of lookers-on watched the
more intently. Now the hare by a clever
turn increased her lead; then once again
the dog made good the ground lost. The
hare had come back by this time almost
to the starting-point. Closer and closer
drew the dog: the hare seemed to be
swaying in her stride. The dog&#8217;s tongue
was out at any length, and his pant was
clearly audible. Once again the hare
doubled, and the dogs with the Over-Lord
gave tongue, as though they
cheered their comrade. Then with a
fling and a dash Murphy was into it:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
there was a scuffle in the snow, and the
next instant the young dog was seen to be
holding the hare down.
</p>
<p>Making his way to the two, taking the
dogs upon leash and thong short by the
head, and keeping them back by the free
use of his feet, the Over-Lord seized the
hare and rescued it; Murphy being too
beat now to do more than lie stretched
out, panting.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m...!&#8221;&mdash;The Over-Lord
was passing a hand as well as he could
over the frightened hare, holding it
high to his chest.&mdash;&#8220;Run to a standstill,
and not so much as harmed. Well,
I&#8217;m...!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He had let go the other dogs now.
They were barking and jumping round
him, and to avoid risk he was covering
up the hare beneath his coat. His face
was a study as he looked at Murphy lying
in the snow. No fault was to be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
found with the dog; that was very certain.
He had been given an opportunity
of showing what he could do. The snow
had equalised the race. And this was the
end&mdash;the hare not hurt at all. He would
look again at her presently. It had been
a pretty sight: Nature&#8217;s working; no real
cruelty in any of it. Such were the
thoughts that were passing in the tall
man&#8217;s mind.
</p>
<p>All turned homeward after that, the
Over-Lord&#8217;s feet scrunching the snow as
he took great strides, a smile lighting up
his face. Four of his dogs were close to
his heels, as though they expected something;
a yard or two behind followed a
younger one, with his tongue out level
with his chest.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Later on in the day, when all the dogs
were kennelled up, the Over-Lord might
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
have been seen leaving the mill-yard,
with something he carried in a bag, taking
long draws at his pipe, and still with
a smile upon his face. He was making
his way alone to the open fields, and
across these to where there was shelter
under a hedge. Having reached his
point, he stooped to the ground; and then
there sped from him, as he rose, a hare,
unharmed in wind and limb.
</p>
<p>He looked long after it, to make sure.
Then he rubbed his chin with his pipe in
his hand, and remarked aloud, &#8220;Run to a
standstill, and never harmed. Well, I&#8217;m...!&#8221;
And once again that day he
checked himself from using a bad, if
sometimes almost pardonable, word.

<p>The general company naturally viewed
Murphy&#8217;s performance from many
standpoints. Among his contemporaries
his reputation went up with a bound,
though there was not wanting a leaven of
jealous ones even amidst those who
crowded most closely round him.
Among those a little older than himself,
the best-natured commended him outspokenly
and in honest generosity of
heart. Others, with more mundane outlook,
judged his achievement reflected
lustre on the kennel, and therefore&mdash;this
with a sniff and the chuck of the chin&mdash;also
on themselves. A few more vowed,
in true sporting spirit, that they would
do their level best to go one better if
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
such a chance as that should come their
way. To these last, the puzzle was why,
with such results, the whole of those
present had not tasted blood; and among
themselves they voted the action of the
Over-Lord incomprehensible, certainly
womanly, very certainly misjudged. If
the young dog had gone up therefore in
their estimation, the Man had correspondingly
gone down.
</p>
<p>As for the older generation, some
spoke patronisingly, as if they wished to
convey that the deed was nothing more
than they could easily have achieved, and
in fact ended by talking so much that
they persuaded themselves, to their own
satisfaction, that they were in the habit
in their younger days of doing things of
the kind not less infrequently than once
a week. The moralists wagged their
heads as the fountain of all truths, and
asserted that such success was a very bad
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
thing for the young. The swaggerers,
who held somewhat aloof, but who had
never done anything in their lives, put on
more side than usual and endeavoured to
carry matters off that way, oblivious, as
ever, of the laughter round the corner.
Lastly, there was that other class, the
crabbed and the crusty, who would, had
they belonged to Us, have retired behind
their papers in the Club windows, but as
it was, and being dogs, merely made off
out of earshot, with their ruffs up,
grumbling to themselves and crabbing
all things.
</p>
<p>There were some of all classes here as
elsewhere. It is indeed surprising how
closely the dog family approximates to
the human. The same counterparts are
to be found in both. We mostly hunt in
packs. And if dogs are wont to bark and
bite and rend, We, on our part, are often
not behind in practising the same
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
strange arts, though not always with the
same sportsmanship and generosity.
</p>
<p>As for Murphy, he took the whole
matter with a skip and a laugh, as if it
was all part of the jolly fun of life, and
as not in any way reflecting credit on
himself. By nature he was modest and
shy, and if he did things occasionally that
were out of the common, he never
seemed to grasp the fact, invariably looking
puzzled and impatient at all praise.
&#8220;Never mind all that; let&#8217;s come on and
look for something else,&#8221; was what he
said, exhibiting in this way, perhaps, one
of those traits of character that made him
so lovable, and that grew to such fair
proportions as he advanced in years.
His disposition was happy and generous,
and though essentially manly&mdash;if such a
term, without offence, is applicable to
dogs&mdash;there was also about him a peculiar
gentleness that was exemplified in all
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
his actions, right down to his inability to
use his teeth. He was never known to
fight; and, what was still more strange,
bones were to him altogether negligible
things.
</p>
<p>For a character such as this to meet
with harsh treatment, much less cruelty,
was, if not to ruin it completely, at least
to undermine all confidence. Yet this,
sad to relate, was now precisely what befell.
Up to this, life had been without
a cloud. Of course, as in every other
society, there had been the necessity of
fending for oneself&mdash;of picking up a
scrap, for instance, quickly, if you
wanted it at all. Such things are good,
and make for progress and development.
But harshness and unkindness, like injustice,
had been altogether foreign to
the mill and all who lived or worked
there. Life sped on in that favoured spot
with as even a surface as that of the river,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
whose waters flowed sluggishly up to the
mill, barring the dam, and then went bubbling
down the race, revivified and having
done its spell, for the time.
</p>
<p>How it came about is not now exactly
discoverable; but just at this period of
Murphy&#8217;s life a decree was issued that
several of the family were to be boarded
out; and the next day the young dog
found himself moved to the home of one
of the mill-hands, half a mile and more
away.
</p>
<p>The cottage stood alone, and the family
inhabiting it consisted of a man and his
wife, and a daughter just finishing her
schooling. Once there had been a son;
but he, like many another in our villages,
had gone out&mdash;all honour to them!&mdash;to
strike a blow for his country some five or
six years before, and had in quite a short
while found a soldier&#8217;s death. His photograph
hung crookedly just above the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
mantelpiece, with another of a group of
his regiment by which he had once set
much store, and yet another of the girl
whom he had hoped some day to make
his wife.
</p>
<p>When the glow fell, and the bald, laconic
message was delivered one winter
evening at the door, the mother bent her
head low; and later, when she found
speech and had dropped the corner of
her apron, was heard to whisper to herself,
&#8220;&#8217;Twas the Almighty&#8217;s will.&#8221; Then
the tears welled up afresh, as she rocked
herself in her chair, gazing at the fire.
</p>
<p>The effect upon the father was different.
&#8220;What...!&#8221; he cried, as though
some one had struck him. A single candle
flickered on the table; his lips were
drawn tight across his teeth; his fingers
clutched the table-lid convulsively, and
he leant across in the direction of his
wife.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What...!&#8221; he exclaimed again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve killed un,&#8221; repeated the wife,
the candle-light reflected in her staring
eyes. &#8220;Seth, Seth,&#8221; she continued, following
her husband, who had taken up
his hat, and was making for the door&mdash;&#8220;oh,
Seth, Seth&mdash;&#8217;tis the Almighty&#8217;s will,
man; I do know for sure it be;&mdash;Seth,
Seth...!&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Seth Moby had gone out into the
night; and from that time forward he
walked as one suffering some injustice.
He had always been a man of uncertain
temper, but this blow appeared to sour
him. It is well to remember that once at
least in his life he had loved deeply.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>The Over-Lord brought Murphy to
the door, and arranged matters with
Martha Moby, just as he had often done
with others in the same way. The day
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
had been wet; the lane on to which the
garden-gate opened was muddy; the dog
had dirty feet. &#8220;You&#8217;ll take care of him,
I know. He&#8217;s a good dog&mdash;a good dog,&#8221;
he repeated, when he left.
</p>
<p>It was after dark when Moby returned.
&#8220;Wants for us to kep the dog, do &#8217;e?
There be a sight too many on &#8217;em about;
and for what he do want to kep such a lot
o&#8217; such curs, nobody can&#8217;t think. A-bringin&#8217;
a&#8217; the dirt into our housen too.
Err ... I&#8217;ll warm yer!&#8221; he added, making
as though he would fling something
at the dog.
</p>
<p>Murphy looked puzzled, and crept into
a corner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t carry on like that, Seth; don&#8217;t
do it, man. The dog&#8217;s a poor, nervous
little thing with we, and don&#8217;t mean to do
no hurt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But it was of no avail. Seth Moby
looked upon Murphy as an interloper,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
and when he could do anything to frighten
him he did, and by any brutal means
in his power. Even the mill-hands remarked
to one another that their mate,
Moby, was a changed man. &#8220;&#8217;Twas like
that wi&#8217; some,&#8221; they said. &#8220;Trouble
sowered &#8217;em, like, and made &#8217;em seem as
though they &#8217;ould throw the Almighty o&#8217;
one side. And once folk got on a downward
grade, same as that, it wasn&#8217;t often
as they was found on the mending hand&mdash;no,
it wasn&#8217;t for sure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>On one occasion, after the first week
was over, Murphy escaped, and appeared
at the mill with a foot or more of rope
trailing from his collar, for latterly he
had been kept tied up. Seth chanced at
that moment to be leaving work, and
brought the dog up short by the head, by
putting his foot upon the rope end almost
before the dog knew that he was there.
He half hanged him taking him back,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
and flung him into the house with an
oath that frightened his child, and made
her run to the back kitchen that she
might not hear what followed; while the
dog crept on his stomach to the corner,
his tail between his legs: he always
moved in this way now, though it is said
he never whimpered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Seth, if you goes on like this,&#8221;
said Mrs. Moby reproachfully, &#8220;there&#8217;ll
be murder, and then trouble to follow:
the Master is not one to put up with
cruelty to any dog. Bless the man&mdash;you&#8217;re
gettin&#8217; like a mad thing. Leave
the dog alone, I tell yer.&#8221; Seth had
taken off his boots, and flung them at the
dog before going up to bed: Mrs. Moby
had been engaged trying to disconcert his
aim.
</p>
<p>That night another foot was heard on
the stairs; there was whispering in the
kitchen; and for several succeeding
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
weeks, and unknown to others, the dog
slept happily with the child, though not
without serious risks of trouble being
thereby made for both.
</p>
<p>At the end of that time the Over-Lord
called. He had been away. He had
heard on his return that all was not well
with the dog, and had come to see for
himself. Murphy had been lying curled
up on a sack in his corner, but when he
heard the well-known footstep he crawled
out, hugging the wall nervously till he
reached the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Murphy, lad!&#8221; exclaimed the Over-Lord,
looking intently at the dog&mdash;&#8220;Murphy,
my little man; that you...!&#8221;
The dog was fawning on him,
saying as plain as speech, &#8220;Take me away
with you; take me away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Over-Lord put his hand down and
patted him. He did not say another
word, as Murphy followed him out, save
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
&#8220;It&#8217;s not you, Mrs. Moby; it&#8217;s not you.&#8221;
He had a great heart for dogs, and began
to blame himself on his way home for
what had evidently occurred. &#8220;If the
man did not want the dog,&#8221; he muttered,
&#8220;he had only got to say so; besides it
was his rent to him: it was not done on
the cheap&mdash;that never does in any line.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When he reached his own house, he
took the young dog in with him&mdash;a thing
almost unprecedented, so far as the rest
of the outside company were able to recall.
They judged their former companion
spoilt, or on the high road to
being so.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was all that hare,&#8221; remarked the
middle-aged.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed the moralists&mdash;&#8220;success
is always pernicious to the young!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lookers-on generally misjudge, though
they claim to see most of the game.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></p>
<p>The next morning, by strange coincidence,
a letter was delivered at the mill,
destined to alter Murphy&#8217;s future altogether.

<p>Daniel was one of those dogs that die
famous, though belonging to a small circle;
not famous in the sense in which the
dogs of history are so, but because he possessed
individuality and stamped himself
upon the memories of all who ever met
him. And these last were not few, for
Dan had travelled widely and had gathered
multitudes of friends. Then, again,
he possessed those two almost indispensable
adjuncts of popularity&mdash;delightful
manners and a beautiful face. It was his
invariable custom to get up when any
one came into a room; and when he advanced
to meet them, it might certainly
have been said that, in his case, the tail
literally wagged the dog, for his hind-quarters
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
were moved from the middle of
his back and went in rhythm with the
tail. His looks were perfect. Being by
Pagan I., he possessed not only eyes set
in black and a coal-black snout, but also
that further characteristic of dogs of his
date, the blackest of black ears&mdash;a feature
now entirely lost in the case of Irish
terriers, and never, it is said, to be regained.
</p>
<p>Apart from a liberal education and the
miscellaneous knowledge he had picked
up for himself, to say nothing of a wonderful
series of clever tricks, the instinct
known as the sense of direction was in his
case developed to an altogether abnormal
extent. Definite traces of this were noticeable
when he was still a puppy; but it
was at all times impossible for him to
lose his way. As he grew older, this instinct
became so marked, that it set others
wondering whether or not there existed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
among dogs a sixth, and perhaps a seventh,
sense, lying far beyond the grasp of
human, limited intelligence.
</p>
<p>Dogs, as we all know, are not the only
animals, that possess this mysterious instinct.
They share it with many other
classes, such as those of the feline tribe,
and also with the birds and a number of
insects. In fact, all animals appear to
possess it in varying degree; they are
all more or less able to find their way
home. Yet, study it how we may, we are
at fault when we try to account for it. In
many cases, the homing instinct is apparently
governed by sight; but many scientific
observers entertain the idea that the
sense of smell, in the majority of instances,
will be found to lie at the root of
the matter. Possibly they are right.
</p>
<p>When, however, we are brought face
to face with an exceptional exhibition of
the sense, we have to confess that we are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
left unconvinced by any of the theories
that have at present been advanced. It
is no unusual thing for a dog to find its
way home along a road it had not previously
travelled, going with the wind,
and in the dark. One case is known to
the writer where a dog found the ship it
had come out in in a foreign port to
which it had been taken, and made a voyage
by sea, as well as a considerable journey
by land on its return to this country,
in order to reach its home. A cat also,
within the writer&#8217;s knowledge, found its
way back to its home, though it had been
brought some distance in a sack lying at
the bottom of a farmer&#8217;s gig, and though
the return journey entailed traversing the
streets of a busy town. Any one may
test a bee&#8217;s powers in the same way, by
affixing to it a small particle of cotton-wool.
When liberated, it will take a perfectly
straight or bee line to its hive,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
though this lie at a considerable distance.
It is unnecessary to refer to the achievements
of carrier-pigeons, when set free
after a long journey and the lapse of
many hours, or to the way in which
rooks, especially, as well as starlings, will
find their way to their usual roosting-places
across wide valleys shrouded in
dense November fogs.
</p>
<p>Nor must we succumb here to the
temptations offered by the very mention
of migrants, though we may well ask,
what is the power that enables a swallow
to leave the banks of the Upper Nile
and arrive at the nest it left the year before,
beneath the eaves of a cottage standing
on the banks of the Upper Thames?
Or what directs the turtle-dove, year by
year, from the oleander-grown banks of
the streams of Morocco to the more
grateful shade of our English woodlands?
Yet marked birds have proved
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
the truth of these and still more wonderful
achievements.
</p>
<p>Instinct, the dire necessity of obtaining
proper food, the perpetuation of the tribe&mdash;Nature&#8217;s
most imperious laws&mdash;lie no
doubt at the back of many mysteries. Yet
to say this is not to account for the sense
before us, any more than it is to solve
those innumerable problems that are
scattered all along our several roads, and
that we stumble over every step we take.
Leaving out of count such systematic,
and apparently scientific, labours as those
of the ants, bees, and wasps, we constantly
find in the animal kingdom powers being
exercised, as, for instance, in the case of
the earthworms and the moles, that are
not to be explained by the use of the
words instinct, intelligence, and necessity.
The humblest of animals appears often
to be handling forces with ease and familiarity,
the range of which it must apparently,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
if not obviously, be unaware.
But if this last is true, and these animals
that are blind walk blind, what are we
to say of ourselves, when we are frequently
doing the same, and handling forces
that we are totally unable to define?
</p>
<p>The digression is a lengthy one; but
even now a further step must be taken.
The man has, in the dog, his one real intimate
in the whole animal world. It
will be generally admitted that the dog
depends exceptionally upon the man and
the man often largely also upon the dog,
and that in this we have yet another instance
of that interdependence that is to
be found throughout Nature and wheresoever
we look. This, however, is not
the chief point in considering the relationship
existing between the two.
There is something much deeper, and
that goes much further.
</p>
<p>Man, we are told, holds supreme dominion
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
on Earth. He is King over all
things living, both great and small; and
this constitutes at once his endowment
and his responsibility. Yet this supreme
power is being perpetually modified,
not only by the forces he seeks to
control&mdash;whose so-called laws he has to
obey, if they are to be subjected to his
use&mdash;but also by those very creatures to
whom he stands in the relation of a King.
It is here, in the animal kingdom, that
the action of the dog once again stands
first; for what powers of modification
and influence can transcend those which
effect a frequent and practical impression
upon the actions of this so-called King,&mdash;by
appealing, as the dog often does, to
man&#8217;s moral sense; by claiming love outside
man&#8217;s own circle, in return for love
given without stint; by calling for a
wider self-sacrifice, in the light of a
trustfulness and loyalty that is exhibited here
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
and nowhere else in Nature in the same
unfaltering degree?
</p>
<p>The dog does all this and more, as will
be shown, and by ways and instincts that
are as unfathomable as the one to which
reference has just been made.
</p>
<p>It is time to return to the more homely
matter of Dan, that instances may be
given of how, on one occasion out of
many, he exhibited the possession of the
sense of direction, and also of the eye he
had for country.
</p>
<p>The writer had to make a journey to a
neighbouring town by rail. The distance
as the crow flies was not more than six
miles, but the railway journey took the
best part of an hour and entailed a
change and waiting at a junction. Daniel
accompanied him, having never made
the journey before, or visited the junction,
or the station of the town referred
to. On arrival, the writer elected to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
walk. Now Daniel was almost entirely
strange to towns, and, though all went
well at first, he finally succumbed to the
fascinations of the streets, and disappeared.
Every means were at once taken
to find him; the police station was visited,
the cab-drivers were warned, and a
reward was offered. In the end, the
writer had to return without the dog, and
face the reproaches of the family. A
gloom fell upon the house for the rest
of the evening. But soon after ten
o&#8217;clock a bark was heard, the front door
was thrown open, and Daniel entered; in
a state, it may be added, that bordered on
hysterics, and with the tail wagging the
dog more violently than ever. It was
seven hours from the time he had been
missed, and no light was ever thrown on
how he had accomplished the journey.
</p>
<p>A dog&#8217;s memory is proverbial. There
is ample reason for believing that many
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
dogs, when once they have smelt your
hand, never forget you. But they also
often appear to make mental notes of
what they see, and to retain these in their
minds. A retriever that has worked long
on an estate will be found to know the position
of almost every gate and stile in
every field, and will use his knowledge
instantly as occasions arise. He equally
appears to know the rides of the woods
within his beat, and where they lead. In
other words, he has, in hunting parlance,
an eye for country; and here is an instance
from Daniel&#8217;s life by way of illustration.
</p>
<p>To reach a neighbouring village on
one occasion, the writer used a tricycle.
There was only one road to this village,
distant five miles, and this was bounded
on one side by woods and on the other by
the river Thames, which it was necessary
to cross at the outset. Here and there between
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
the road and the river were houses,
the gardens and grounds of which were
surrounded by walls and fencing extending
to the river-banks. The tow-path
was on the further side. It chanced that
after three miles had been traversed, another
tricycle caught up the writer and
passed him. Dan was ahead, mistook this
machine for his own, and went on out of
sight. The weather looking threatening,
the writer decided to return home, feeling
confident that the dog would discover
his mistake and follow. A bicycle now
overtook the writer, the rider of which,
in answer to inquiries, said that he had
seen an Irish terrier entering the village
he had left, three miles back, cantering in
front of a tricycle. There was nothing
to be done but to go leisurely home, waiting
every now and then to see if the dog
was coming, while growing always more
and more uneasy at his non-appearance.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
At last the home was reached&mdash;and on
the front-door mat sat Daniel!
</p>
<p>The dog was perfectly dry, and had
still the dust of the road on him. He
could not therefore have swum the river;
moreover, he had no taste for water.
Equally, he had not come along the only
road; while it was impossible for him to
have travelled through the woods or
along the land lying between the road
and the river. There was only one solution
of the difficulty, and this was undoubtedly
correct. In his walks along
the hills the dog must have noticed a railway
in the valley and its bridge across
the river. He had certainly never been
along this railway or over this bridge.
But he remembered its existence when he
was lost, made his way to it, got over the
river without the necessity of swimming,
and reached home across country in time
to meet his master, and with an expression
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
on his face of, &#8220;Well&mdash;what do you
say to that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>One more story of him must be given,
showing his extraordinary sagacity as
well as his determination. When he had
set his mind on anything, brick walls
were well-nigh powerless to stop him.
He obeyed one man, if he were by; in his
absence, he acted solely in furtherance of
the plans he had in mind, and always
with a knowing expression on his face.
</p>
<p>He was paying a visit in the West of
England, and had quickly found his way
about. One day at luncheon some one
was rash enough to remark in Dan&#8217;s hearing
that the carriage was going out. To
run with the carriage was strictly forbidden,
and this Dan never failed to resent,
as he did also being shut up before
the carriage came round. &#8220;Carriage&#8221;
was one of the thirty-eight words with
which he was intimately acquainted, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
when he heard it used on this occasion he
may have made mental notes concerning
plans to which he vowed he would be no
party. However this may have been,
shortly before the hour arrived for the
carriage to start Dan could nowhere be
found.
</p>
<p>The road leading from the house
branched into three at the end of about
a mile; and, as this point opened to view
on the afternoon in question, a yellow figure
was seen to be standing there motionless,
evidently waiting to see which of the
three ways the carriage would take.
Needless to say it was Dan, and that of
course he had his run.
</p>
<p>But an end must be made of chronicling
the further remarkable achievements
of this wholly remarkable dog&mdash;his
sage comments as he grew older, his faithful
discharge of his duties as he roamed
the passages at night, his intense love of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
sport and his deeds in that field in spite of
his being hopelessly gun-shy, his large
heart, and those beautiful manners which
he still made pathetic efforts to show, even
when he moved with great difficulty and
was both deaf and almost blind. He was
just a high-bred gentleman; and he had
about him something of the courtesy of
the old school, which will still be discernible
in some dogs when we have finally
and altogether lost the art ourselves.
</p>
<p>Daniel was now growing old, if indeed
he had not already done so. It was obvious
that he could not last much longer&mdash;perhaps
a year; not more&mdash;and it was
necessary, therefore, to find an understudy.
Irish terriers had been a part of
the household for many years. Yet another
must be discovered, though, as all
agreed, there could never be another like
Dan.
</p>
<p>Thus it came about that inquiries were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
made in likely quarters, and a letter was
despatched to one who could be trusted,
and who was known the country over for
the dogs he owned.
</p>

<h2>V</h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; came the answer; &#8220;I think I have
just the dog to suit you. With an old
dog in the house such as you describe,
every dog would not do; but the one I
speak of is a <i>good</i> dog, with good manners
and a very gentle disposition. You
know that I do not make a practice of
selling my dogs, but you shall have this
one for &mdash;&mdash; guineas, and I will send him
along any day that may suit you.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I forgot to say he is well-bred;
Postman-Barbara. He is entered as
Murphy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Two days later a dog&#8217;s travelling-box
was put out on to the platform of a little
country station, and there and then duly
opened by the writer. Lying at the bottom
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
in some hay was a poor, cringing
little animal, that had to be lifted out,
and then lay flat upon the platform. In
such terror was he that nothing would
induce him to move; and the only way
out of the difficulty was to take him up,
while others smiled, and walk out of the
station with him.
</p>
<p>At a quiet turn of the road the dog
was put down, being somewhat heavy,
when once again he could not be persuaded
to walk, or even to stand upon his
feet. Again and again he acted in this
way, till at length the house was reached
and he was deposited on a mat by the
fire, close to a bowl of good food.
</p>
<p>And this poor little abject was Murphy!&mdash;Murphy,
the dog with the pedigree
of kings and even emperors; the dog
that had run a hare to a standstill; the
dog of the happiest disposition of any one
in the kennel, and that had been the favourite
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
and playmate of the whole great
company. If this was what pedigrees
were likely to produce, better to make a
clean sweep of the hereditary principle
at once; if this was a picture of a happy
disposition, better to try what chronic
depression had to show. A sorry favourite
this. Up to now a suspicion had been
entertained that a playmate should at
least be gay. It was all evidently a
mistake.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Murphy!&#8221;&mdash;Why, this half-starved-looking
thing that refused to stir or eat
did not even know his name. If a move
was made in his direction, he hugged the
ground closer than before, shifting his
chin backwards and forwards on the rug
in abject terror. The coast had purposely
been left clear, and Dan was out
with the rest of the family.
</p>
<p>Presently one looked in, and passed
sentence without more ado: &#8220;Oh, you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
poor, miserable, shrunken little thing.
We can&#8217;t keep a dog like that&mdash;it is impossible!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Later, Dan appeared. The young dog
got up, went respectfully towards him,
and licked him deliberately upon the lips.
Dan wagged his tail. They were friends.
Then once again the newcomer crept on
his stomach to the corner of the hearthrug,
and remained there cringing when
any one went near. What did it all
mean?
</p>
<p>Nor were matters any better when the
household retired for the night: in truth,
they were much worse. The most mysterious
sounds ascended from the lower
floor, and grew steadily in volume. They
woke one and then another, till at last
they drew some one from her bed. Such
unearthly groans had rarely before been
heard from throat of living thing. Of
course it was the &#8220;new dog,&#8221; as he had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
already come to be called, for he surely
was not worthy of a name.
</p>
<p>A conference was held next day as to
what could possibly be done, though with
the usual result that some said one thing,
some another, and nothing was definitely
decided on. Had the matter been put to
the vote, the dog would almost certainly
have been forthwith returned from
whence he came, in spite of a remark
from one quarter that such a course
might result in something serious.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Give a dog a bad name...&#8217; We all
know the rest. To return this dog is for
him almost certainly to be shot&mdash;at least,
I wouldn&#8217;t give a penny for his life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Murphy meanwhile lay curled up tight
on his corner of the hearthrug, with his
eyes wide open, watching every movement
intently. Dan said nothing, and
went his way, voting the house to be upside
down.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span></p>
<p>That day passed without improvement,
though every effort was made and a walk
was taken in the fields: the night, the
stranger spent in company, for he appeared
to have a dread of being left
alone. The day following matters were
unfortunately made worse. It is the fate
of many who are down to find themselves
trodden on: the lucky meet with luck;
the unlucky, more often, with misfortune.
The world is full of remarkably strange
ordinances; or rather, it might be said,
life is replete with incidents that are
often the last wished for. From him that
hath not shall be taken away, not alone
that which he hath, but even that also
which &#8220;he seemeth to have.&#8221; So be it.
No doubt, in the majority of instances,
he deserves to be so made bereft. On
some, however, such things come hard.
</p>
<p>The room in which Murphy had taken
up his abode was part library, part
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
studio, and part a good many other
things. A large picture&mdash;the canvas
measured six feet&mdash;was being worked
upon on this second morning after the
young dog&#8217;s arrival; and, as was perversely
ruled, it was just here that an accident
occurred that might well have
been judged impossible. The easel, in
fact, with its huge canvas, was overset,
carrying many things into limbo as they
fell; and with the fate that too often pursues
the unfortunate, Murphy therefore
found himself suddenly buried beneath
a mixed assortment of articles to which
he had hitherto been strange. To add to
the rest, a whole string of cattle and sheep
bells, brought from various parts of the
world, were set ringing, and others were
dislodged; and for the moment it appeared
that the dog must certainly have
been killed. The only good thing subsequently
gathered from the strange proceedings
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
was that the dog had uttered no
whimper. But if he was frightened before,
he was terror-stricken now; and
matters had therefore gone from bad to
worse.
</p>
<p>There is little need to describe what
followed. On the one hand, it was
judged that this was the proverbial last
straw; that the dog would assuredly
never recover now; and that therefore
the only thing to be done was to send him
back, with an earnest appeal for his life
to be spared. Yet, once again, cooler
judgments in the end prevailed. The
dog had not whimpered. There was
something in that. Moreover, by what
had now occurred, an injury had been
done to his already unhappy spirit, and,
unless all honour had ceased to find a
place between man and dog, reparation
was certainly his due. In one quarter a
sense of pity had furthermore been generated&mdash;a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
fact, though unsuspected at the
time, that was to prove the hub round
which Murphy&#8217;s whole future was destined
to revolve. An appeal to the heart,
if such once gets home, can never really
fail&mdash;unless, as Murphy&#8217;s countrymen
might say, the person appealed to proves
heartless.
</p>
<p>Thus it was that a sheet of paper that
left the house the same evening contained
words to this effect:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I ought to have written to you before
about Murphy, as also to have sent you
the enclosed cheque. But, to tell you
the truth, I have been so much puzzled
by this dog that I have purposely waited
a day or two before writing to you. I
have owned dogs for a great many years
and of many breeds and temperaments;
but never, in the whole of my experience,
have I come across any dog as nervous as
this one: it is pitiful to see him. Even
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
my old dog&#8217;s presence does not help him;
and really, so far, I have been able to
make nothing of him. Perhaps he may
get better; but I almost doubt it. I wonder
if, without you knowing it yourself,
the dog has been cruelly treated. I keep
looking at him and wondering, for I cannot,
somehow, link this dog lying in front
of me, and never closing his eyes,
with the description you wrote of him.
The journey would not account for
it. However, we must hope for the
best.&#8221;
</p>
<p>To this came answer:
</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;In face of what you tell me of the
dog, I cannot of course accept your
cheque, and therefore return it. But do
please keep the dog for a month or six
weeks, or as long as you like, and write
to me again then. I assure you the dog
is a <i>good</i> dog. Perhaps his surroundings
are strange to him. They must be. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
old dog will help him to come round, I
feel sure.&#8221;
</p>
</div>
<p>A few days later the door opened, and
a stranger was announced. Murphy was
on the hearthrug, as usual; the canvas
and easel had been banished to a corner,
and an effort was being made to accustom
Murphy to the clicking of a typewriter&mdash;a
sound concerning which he was evidently
doubtful.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Murphy; you&#8217;re a nice dog,
aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; The dog had gone to the
door, and the great figure of the Over-Lord
was stooping to notice him. &#8220;I always
like to see where my dogs go, if
possible,&#8221; he added; &#8220;and I wanted to
hear from you, as well as to see for myself,
what was the matter, for this is a
good dog&mdash;a nice dog: I know he is.
He&#8217;ll come all right. Just please give
him time; and then, if you don&#8217;t like him,
send him back. He is as good a dog&mdash;gentle, you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
know, gentle&mdash;as I&#8217;ve bred.
Why, I can assure you, I refused (mentioning
several hundred pounds)&mdash;I refused
that sum for a pair of his relations,
only last year; so you will judge he is
well enough in the matter of class.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you refuse? Most people
would have jumped at such an offer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;I&#8217;ll tell you. I didn&#8217;t like the
man&#8217;s face that wanted them; nothing
else: I always like to see where my dogs
go and the people they go to; and, after
getting your letter, I determined to make
the journey here, as soon as ever I could
get the time. He&#8217;s a nice dog; a good
dog&mdash;I&#8217;m sure of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t think there is anything in
the suggestion I made to account for his
extreme nervousness, do you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;I know now that there is. I
only got to the bottom of it, though, this
morning. These things aren&#8217;t arrived at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
in a minute, you know. One working-man
very rarely splits upon another.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then followed the whole story. &#8220;It
was cruel&mdash;cruel,&#8221; he jerked out at the
end, finishing with, &#8220;I may as well tell
you, I never liked the man. Latterly his
work was anyhow&mdash;went from bad to
worse, and I discharged him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was silence. Two great big men
were sitting looking at the dog lying between
them. The dog&#8217;s eyebrows moved
continually: his brilliant eyes travelled
from one to the other; and presently he
heaved a deep sigh, as much as to say,
&#8220;It&#8217;s all quite true&mdash;quite true.&#8221;
</p>
<p>If there had been hesitation about
keeping Murphy before, there was an
end to it now. Here was a dog&mdash;a young
life&mdash;that had once, and not so long ago,
been the delight of the kennel, the very
embodiment of light-hearted fun and
happiness; the most promising of all the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
younger lot, and one that had never been
guilty of wrong. Send him back! Give
him up! What might his fate be if he
went elsewhere? Death? Look at him.
Look at his large brilliant eyes. They
betoken nervousness, of course&mdash;inherent
nervousness, probably. A cruel injustice
had been done by this dumb thing, and
by one of Us. Give him up! Clearly
everything most prized was at stake, and
claimed the exact opposite.
</p>
<p>Why should a different justice be the
lot of a dog to that meted out to a man?
Is the superiority all one way? Each
man knows in his heart that it is not; that
the dog is often the better of the two.
</p>
<p>How the thoughts raced through the
brain!
</p>
<p>&#8220;Murphy?&#8221; It was his new master
that called him now.
</p>
<p>Perhaps the presence of the Over-Lord
had given the young dog confidence: <i>he</i>,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
at least, had been linked with happy
times. Murphy got up hesitatingly and
came to his new master&#8217;s chair, with his
ears drooping. He even suffered himself
to be taken into this new master&#8217;s lap,
though not without great nervousness.
</p>
<p>And after that the Over-Lord rose and
said good-bye.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Murphy, we won&#8217;t part,&#8221; were
the last words he heard as he left the
door; and this was the last time the generous
Over-Lord was destined ever to
set eyes on Murphy.

</div>

<p>Others laughed when they heard the
final verdict, and called the undertaking
hopeless and sentimental. The hopelessness
remained to be proved; and, as to the
sentimental part of the business, some one
averred that sentiment lay at the bottom
of most things. It might be unpractical
from a philosophic point of view, as well
as often fitting matter for a jibe; but
sentiment, all the same, was generally a
source of strength! Without it neither
nation nor man would be likely to get
far; it reflected the noblest part of man&#8217;s
nature, and touched a nation at its quick,
if flags meant anything, and were to be
followed and set store by.
</p>
<p>There was quite a bandying of words
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
over the matter. This dog was so different
to Dan. It was not a matter of argument,
certainly not on abstruse points.
The dog had been broken in nerve, and
admittedly by ill-usage. Probably he
had been nervous from the first, and there
was therefore all the less chance of his
recovery.
</p>
<p>To this was interposed the fact that
many well-bred dogs are constitutionally
nervous, and continue to be so all their
lives, their condition in this respect being
probably largely due to their brain development
and increased powers of imagination.
</p>
<p>That might be the case, came the answer;
but all the same&mdash;how about the
tail? The nervous organisation of this
dog and his imagination had to do with
his brain, which his eyes showed to be
capable of development. These points
had to do with the head. What about the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
other end? The index to a dog&#8217;s character,
as well as to his immediate proceedings,
lies, as we all know, in his tail&mdash;the
angle at which it is held, the way it moves
or remains stiff and immovable; its position
before a fight, its twist to one side
when stalking, its confident carriage
when the owner has &#8220;got his tail up.&#8221;
All these are so many signals, generally
recognised by man and other dogs alike.
Granting all this, what was to be said
here? This dog had now been several
days in the house, and no one had apparently
seen his tail: it had been kept firmly
down, and in such a way as to suggest that
had it been long enough it would have
been well between his legs.
</p>
<p>At this, some one said that he had seen
it once, and it was bushy; the only effect
of this remark being to elicit the rejoinder
that &#8220;<i>then</i> it wanted pulling.&#8221; Another
averred that, of course, nothing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
could be hoped for till he got his tail up:
the job was how to set about securing so
essential a condition in the case of the
tail of this particular dog. No doubt the
first thing to be done was to win him to
the habit of standing on his feet: it was
obviously impossible to attempt anything
with the tail till this was achieved. So
far, his attitude had been best describable
as that of the prone position. If anybody
moved, he crouched still lower; if
he was persuaded to enter another room
than the one he had particularly taken
to, he grovelled; if there was any sudden
movement or noise, he was terror-stricken;
and, added to all this, it
was obvious that he could never be
a watch-dog, for he refused to sleep
alone.
</p>
<p>Of course he ought to have gone back;
and all these notions about &#8220;bringing him
round,&#8221; giving him another chance and a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
happy life, were so much high faluting
rubbish.
</p>
<p>In the face of such arguments, based,
as they obviously were, on universal testimony,
even the faith of the person most
nearly concerned and wholly responsible
must, it was judged, eventually give way.
</p>
<p>But if counsels and opinions alike
failed to alter the decision that had been
come to, they equally also supplied no
answer to the momentous question&mdash;how,
seeing he was to be kept, was the confidence
of this dog to be won? There was
hope in Dan, of course. He would teach
him plenty of things, and tell him much
besides. A good deal of faith was placed
in this direction. But, even then, what
about the general training? This dog
would run riot, be disobedient and unruly,
hunt when and where he should not,
like other dogs before him, or even run
sheep. If these things happened, what
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
was to be done? To thrash him would be
almost an act of cruelty by a dog of such
a temperament: it might make him more
nervous than ever, even if he could be
caught for the purpose and made to understand
the rudiments of cause and effect.
Dan had learnt to &#8220;come and be
thrashed,&#8221; when such was necessary and
he was summoned in those most ominous
of words. It might be possible to teach
Murphy in the same way: dogs, somehow
or other, were almost universally capable
of differentiating between justice and injustice,
and bore no resentment. The reflection
gave relief. Yet what would be
the effect upon this dog if Dan was in
trouble and took to shouting &#8220;Murder,&#8221;
as he usually did long before he felt the
stick?
</p>
<p>The problems were many, and grew in
number the more the whole matter was
considered. Two things shaped themselves
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
from the first: there must be absolute
fairness and justice; and, what was
of no less importance, there must never
be any trace of loss of temper in what had
to be done, however trying the case might
be. To show anger, to give an extra
stroke when the stick was up, to be hasty
for an instant, would be to fail ignominiously,
to the mutual unhappiness of
both.
</p>
<p>The whole enterprise was thus obviously
full of pitfalls. Yet faith declared
this way: by kindness, sympathy,
and self-control the end might be
attained, confidence won back, the young
life put into touch with happiness
again.
</p>
<p>As the further aspect of the question
was considered, it looked rather as if,
while the man was trying to train the dog,
the dog might equally be all the time
training the man. Here was one none
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
too strong, whose nervous organisation
had been shattered, and whose confidence
had been wholly undermined. To win
back what had been lost would be difficult
enough in the case of a man; how
would it be in the case of a dog? Oddly
enough, too, the conditions of life of
neither party here were of the normal
kind&mdash;in one case never could be so. Yet
here were these two, and by the merest
chance, placed in juxtaposition. A
strange link was forging itself apparently,
quite unknown to both, and coupling
the one firmly to the other, though
neither was aware of it.
</p>
<p>It was not until some time had passed
that the position took a more definite
form, and the question repeated itself&mdash;what
if sympathy grew up and blossomed
into something fair, with love and
mutual confidence as its accompaniments?
Such might result, perhaps.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
The thought added interest to the problem
as it floated through the mind and
was lost again.
</p>
<p>There was nothing uncommon in the
possible situation; it had occurred again
and again. History furnished innumerable
instances. Folklore, with its roots
in truth, told endless stories of similar
complexion. The Dog and the Man; the
interdependence of both: living things of
like passions&mdash;sharers of like passions;
fellow-helpers, the advancement of the
one having kept pace with that of the
other, right up from the days when, in
prehistoric times and the Neolithic age,
as is shown by the bones that are found,
the dog shared the home of the man and
partook of his food&mdash;right up from the
days when the Egyptians, though they
dubbed him unclean, worshipped this
animal, and, because of his fidelity and
courage, gave him a place as one among
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
three who were to share with them the
joys of Paradise.
</p>
<p>The same story is to be traced through
all the ages. Even Ulysses could shed a
tear for Argus, hiding the fact as well as
he might from Eumæus; and Tristrem
and Ysolde, in the legend, took Hodain
to be their intimate companion, because
he had once shared with them &#8220;the drink
of might.&#8221; So, too, the great Theron
walked as the close companion of the
Gothic king; and Cavall became the
trusty servant and liegeman of King Arthur.
The huge white hound Gorban sat
ever at the side of the Welsh bard Ummad
as he sang his songs; and the beautiful
Bran was the friend for life of Fingal.
Most men have heard of William the
Silent&#8217;s spaniel, who saved his master&#8217;s
life; and many may have seen the form of
the dog, fashioned in white marble, lying
at his master&#8217;s feet on the well-known
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
tomb at Delft. We have each read of
Scott&#8217;s Maida. And if some, perhaps,
have made a pilgrimage to that long and
narrow mound in the vale of Gwyant
which, according to tradition, marks the
resting-place of the immortal Gelert,
others have read of the faithful Vigr who
never again tasted food when he learnt
that Olaf, his master, lay dead.
</p>
<p>The stories are without end; and romance
knows no limits when dealing with
the subject. The lives of the Man and
the Dog are found to be ever intertwined.
Yet is there always this besides&mdash;the rift
in the lute and the familiar refrain, that
the life of the dog shall be short, and that
Man shall go on his way with his head
bent, till such time as he shall become
rich once more in the love of a new-found
friend&mdash;if that be always possible.
</p>
<p>No man, it has been well said, can be
deemed unhappy who possesses the love
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
of a dog; and none are too poor to win it,
as none are too high to rejoice and grow
glad in it. The dog, at least, knows no
difference of class or place in his attachments.
To him his home is his home;
his master, his master and friend, whether
his lot be to follow the tramp on the
road, or to walk behind a king to the
tomb. And perhaps it may be due to the
mystery lying at the back of this wonderful
intimacy and connection, stretching
far back into an altogether hidden past,
that to strike another man&#8217;s dog unjustly
is equivalent to striking him; that to hurt
a dog with intent is to earn the worst
of characters and to stain one&#8217;s kind; and
that for a dog to be in trouble and claim
aid is for him to claim also the man&#8217;s
heart&mdash;even, as has many a time occurred,
the man&#8217;s life&mdash;to the infinite
glory of both.
</p>
<p>Nor has it been only on man&#8217;s side that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
such deeds of heroism have been exhibited.
The man, the woman, and the
child have undoubtedly gone to the dog&#8217;s
help at the risk of their own lives on
many an occasion; but so also has the dog
risked his for the sake of the man&mdash;not
from any moral claim, not because life
is a precious thing and must be saved,
not because of that power which impels,
and whose chief gift is the sense of after-satisfaction
that comes even to the most
disinterested; such things lie necessarily
beyond the reach of the dog mind. What
the dog does is done for love, because
of his faith, and because, unlike any
other living animal, he thinks, in his unselfishness,
more of his friend than he
ever does about himself.
</p>
<p>On the shores of a lake in Travancore,
not far from the remote cantonment of
Quillon, stands a monument to the memory
of a dog. He was left to watch his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
master&#8217;s clothes while bathing. Presently
he was seen to be doing everything
in his power to attract attention, by barking
and running excitedly backwards and
forwards on the shore. An advancing
ripple was then discerned on the smooth
surface of the lake, and the next instant
the meaning of this flashed home. A
crocodile had got between the swimmer
and the landing-place, and was coming
out to seize his prey. Hope might well
have been stricken dead in the face of
such a situation. But the dog did not
hesitate. Plunging into the water, he
swam out to get between the horrid reptile
and his master, and thus to head him
off. It meant his own certain death; but
the saving of his master&#8217;s life. A moment
later there was a violent agitation
of the water, and the dog had disappeared
for ever. Thus there stands to
record his splendid action this well-known
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
monument, erected by his master
in deepest gratitude, and that passers-by
might learn of what a dog is
capable.
</p>
<p>The incident is not the only one of its
kind, and may be left to speak for itself.
But the influence of that one act has probably
been world-wide; and it is because
of the exhibition of such qualities that the
moral power of the dog reaches to greater
lengths than is generally supposed.
There is indeed ample evidence for believing
that the beauties often traceable
in the character of the dog re-act unconsciously,
and for infinite good, upon the
roughest of our own kind&mdash;by claiming
unselfishness from those who otherwise
may lay claim to possessing little; by
showing what love may be under stress
and strain, hardship and rough fare; by
the exhibition of patience and faithfulness;
by those instincts that make the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
most depraved of lookers-on pause and
think, and ask the question sharply&mdash;&#8220;Whence
that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>In Kingsley&#8217;s <i>Hypatia</i>, Raphael Ben
Azra, his head filled with a false philosophy,
is made again and again to act
otherwise than he would by the mastiff
Bran.
</p>
<p>The &#8220;dog looks up in his face as only
a dog can,&#8221; and causes him to follow her
and to retrace his steps against his will.
There are her puppies. Is she to leave
them to their fate? He tells her to choose
between the ties of family and duty: it is
a specious form of appeal. To her, duties
begin with the family; the puppies
cannot be left behind. Nor can she carry
them herself. She takes Raphael by the
skirt, after bringing the puppies to him
one by one. He must carry them, she
tells him; and once again he finds himself
doing the opposite of what he would:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
the puppies are transferred to his blanket,
and he and his dog go forward together.
</p>
<p>&#8220;After all,&#8221; he says to himself, &#8220;these
have as good a right to live as I have....
Forward! whither you will, old lady.
The world is wide. You shall be my
guide, tutor, queen of philosophy, for the
sake of this mere common-sense of
yours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He tramps on after that, &#8220;trying to get
the dog&#8217;s lessons by heart.&#8221; He catches
himself asking the dog&#8217;s advice, till he
exclaims irritably, &#8220;Hang these brute
instincts! They make one very hot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At last, by the dog&#8217;s means and the example
of energy that she sets, he is instrumental
in effecting the rescue of Victoria&#8217;s
father. Then, as the distracted
girl throws herself at his feet, and calls
him &#8220;her saviour and deliverer sent by
God,&#8221; even Ben Azra has to admit that
the credit is not in reality his. &#8220;Not in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
the least, my child,&#8221; he exclaims. &#8220;You
must thank my teacher, the dog, not me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The experiences of the philosopher in
the novel are only those of many in real
life. Man is not the only civilising agent
in this world of many mysteries. And if
we often exclaim, &#8220;Bother the dog!&#8221; we
have still very frequently to follow where
he leads, and often to our most definite
enrichment in the end.

<h2>VII</h2>
</div>

<p>It was four months before any improvement
was discernible: it was a year before
confidence could really be said to
have grown at all. In some directions it
never grew. For instance, of labouring
men, gardeners, and the like, Murphy
always remained shy. It was in no spirit
of unforgivingness, for he was perfectly
civil; neither did he owe them any
grudge, grudges being forbidden usually
by dog law and only entertained by the
poorest characters of all. Thus he never
became familiar, even with those he met
daily: his memory was phenomenal, and
by passing by on the other side he showed
that his associations in this direction were
unhappy.
</p>
<p>It fell to this dog&#8217;s lot to live a very
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
quiet life and to be thrown with few&mdash;either
dogs or men. His days were regulated
by his master&#8217;s doings, and these
again were regulated, of necessity, by
method. The weeks came, and ran their
course, and did not vary very greatly one
from the other. There was the daily
round of work&mdash;almost incessant work,
life being supportable that way and in
no other. There was the break, half-way
through the morning, of a run of a quarter
of an hour, wet or shine. There was
the walk across country in the afternoon,
also totally irrespective of the weather.
There was the turn at night under similar
conditions. That was the dog&#8217;s day in
winter-time; perhaps also the man&#8217;s. In
spring and summer both lived under the
sky, and regarded a house only as a place
to sleep in. Habit is second nature. Interests
were many, and in some directions
ran parallel&mdash;sporting instincts, especially,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
being quite ineradicable. Life for
both was thus exceeding happy; and life
grew always happier with friendship:
that is as it should be.
</p>
<p>With those he met Murphy was genial,
if shy. He grew to love the members
of his little home circle; though
three of the quartet ever averred that, in
reality, he only loved one wholly and altogether,
and clung to him in a way that
others noticed&mdash;folk on the land always
referring to them, the country over, as
&#8220;Him and his dog.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Were they not always together? The
shepherds on the downs recognised them
at great distances, for shepherds see far.
The shepherds&#8217; dogs knew them equally
well, and they see furthest. The ploughmen
in the hollows caught sight of them
against the skyline in the waning winter
day, when the team grew weary as they
themselves&mdash;which last fact, too, made
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
these best of men shout with full lungs,
&#8220;Please, will you tell us the time!&#8221; The
man with the hand-drill sowing the
spring seeds; the poorer folk, men and
women with their buckets, stone-picking
in the chill, autumnal weather; the stockmen
as they drove the cattle home, or
called them from the lush fields with the
crack of a whip&mdash;spring-time and harvest,
all the seasons through; in wind and
rain, in the great heat, in the snow and
the blizzard, it was always the same.
And thus, in this unenclosed country,
where there were great woods, but where
hedges were almost non-existent, the men
of the land would look up and pass the
remark to their mates, with a jerk of the
head, &#8220;Ther&#8217;s &#8217;im an&#8217; &#8217;is dog; see?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Outside the home circle&mdash;though, to
be sure, a dog is, or should always be considered,
a part of the family&mdash;Murphy&#8217;s
passion was for Dan. He invariably got
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
up when Dan entered the room, and often
licked him many times upon the lips: he
paid him every kind of attention; bullied
him to play when out of doors; woke him
when he judged it was not fitting he
should be asleep; and, in fact, made a
young dog of him again for a time,
though Dan was really old. He already
owed Dan a good deal, for Dan had initiated
him into many things concerning
rabbits, rats, and the rest, that all self-respecting
dogs should know. Thus the
old dog being an inveterate sportsman,
Murphy followed suit&mdash;and both were,
at all risks, encouraged so to be.
</p>
<p>As Murphy furnished and grew
stronger he naturally became more handsome,
till passers-by would turn and remark
upon the pair&mdash;the old dog and the
young, lying on the bank of the river, patiently,
while some one did mysterious
things with paints; or they were seen returning
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
together in the evening, sitting
side by side in the stern of a boat. They
were certainly a very uncommon pair.
</p>
<p>Dan&#8217;s character had been, of course,
fully formed long ago, and a truly wonderful
character it was, as has already
been related. Murphy&#8217;s was still in the
making. If the whole of the first year
was a period of difficulty, the first four
months might well have staggered any
one undertaking a self-imposed task of
such a nature. The ideal aimed at was
never suffered to be out of sight, but, like
most ideals, it had a trick at times of receding
almost beyond the range of hope.
It was not that the dog was continually
doing wrong. Perhaps it would have
been better if he had been, for then there
would have been something tangible.
The difficulty consisted in conveying to
the dog what he should not do, without
frightening him, and without getting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
cross and losing temper. To train a dog
that takes his thrashing, shakes himself,
lays his ears back, and prepares for the
next, oblivious of consequences, is not
beyond the wit of man, though possibly
a gift. But what is to be done in the case
of a dog that is terror-stricken, even if
the voice is raised? The position forms
as fine a period of probation in its way
as any that wilful man could desire; and
at that the matter may be left.
</p>
<p>The philosopher tells us that we advance
more surely by making mistakes
than we do by lines more usually held to
be right. Murphy took the former and
apparently correct course, like others before
him. The first real stride he made
was thus in connection with an error, and
it did him a world of good. It came
about like this.
</p>
<p>By way of preface&mdash;what can possibly
be more irritating to a dog than sheep?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
Master and dog were coming home together,
and were persistently mobbed by
a party of a dozen. Both agreed that if
any real pluck lay at the back of the
attentions so freely bestowed, the view
entertained of the proceedings might be
somewhat modified. But both were well
aware that there was nothing of the kind;
that the bold front was a sham, that inquisitiveness
was the origin of it all, and
that funk in reality filled every one of
those dozen hearts, however much their
owners hustled forward or lifted up their
heads and stamped.
</p>
<p>How long would Murphy stand such
gross effrontery? That was the question
of the moment. So far, he had followed
close to heel, with his tail down&mdash;though
it is fair to him to say that latterly he had
come to carry it erect. Possibly the sheep
approached closer than any dog of spirit
could endure, or one frightened the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
others and they began to run away. In
a moment it was all over; the sheep had
turned tail, and Murphy was after them,
and had even found his voice.
</p>
<p>The field was one of five-and-thirty
acres, so there was plenty of room for
him to turn them this way and that. To
continue calling was, of course, useless.
Time was better employed in taking a
grip of the feelings and deciding on what
was to be done. To make matters worse,
the farmer himself was seen to be viewing
the proceedings from a distant gateway.
He would undoubtedly expect the law to
be carried out, and dogs that ran sheep
to be either broken to better ways or shot.
It made no difference that the sheep were
not his but &#8220;on tack&#8221; in his fields. What
was the lot of these might be the lot of
his another day. A thrashing was, therefore,
now imperative. But how was this
to be administered, when the only weapon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
was a shooting-stick, and the site was the
middle of a large grass field? The best
thing to do was to sit down, and be
patient.
</p>
<p>A part of the dog&#8217;s education had already
been that he was to stop when his
master stopped, and when the latter sat
or lay down he was to come in. He had
already responded in a small way to this
training, and now he dropped his games
with the sheep, left them, and came
slowly back. He guessed that something
was about to happen by his master&#8217;s
solemn silence, and therefore approached
with caution. It is never necessary in the
case of ordinary offences and with ordinary
dogs to be over severe with the stick&mdash;if
a suitable one is handy, which it generally
is not. A lecture and a shaking
does as well, with a tap or two with a
stick to show it is there. Provoking as
the incident had been, this last is what
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
Murphy duly received. The shooting-stick
was much brandished in the air, and
the dog called &#8220;Murder,&#8221; long and
loudly. The delinquent was evidently
catching it, judged the farmer; and he
waved his arm and disappeared.
</p>
<p>That was gained, any way: what about
the dog? He had learnt what the rattle
of the shooting-stick meant. He had also
learnt that sheep were to be suffered in
their stupid, irritating ways, and not
chased. For a short while he took the
matter to heart, being always woefully
depressed when he even thought he had
done wrong. But he soon recovered, and
showed contrition in the winning way he
had now begun to acquire&mdash;by coming up
shyly from behind, and endeavouring to
reach the fingers of his master&#8217;s hand.
</p>
<p>The whole episode proved a success&mdash;from
the man&#8217;s point of view, at least;
in the case of the dog and the sheep no
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
doubt it was coloured. Murphy had certainly
acquired confidence by what had
happened, just as a boy may, when he
gets his first fall out hunting, and finds
himself less hurt than he fancied would
be the case in turning a somersault.
Added to this, there was also gain in the
fact that from that day forward he was
immaculate with sheep, as will be seen.
</p>
<p>Though Murphy was quickly judged
as one who had been &#8220;born good,&#8221; and
continued to be so regarded all his life,
it is not to be supposed that he never
transgressed, and thereby never incurred
the punishment of a shaking. He was
canine, as men are human; the two terms
are equally synonymous with error, and
faults, one way or the other, have to suffer
correction. But in his case, the faults
of which he was guilty were almost invariably
confined to those of a petty and
irritating description&mdash;exhibition of nervousness
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
when there was no need, failure
in the recognition of his name, lifelong
inability to get out of the way of traffic
on the roads, which made walks along
roads very rare occurrences indeed, and
many others of a like nature. Had it
been otherwise, where would have been
the training for both? On the one hand,
there was always the ideal of enabling
this dog to regain confidence in the
human being, and making him the merry,
happy fellow he had once been; on the
other, there was the test as to whether
this could be done without loss of hope
in the face of repeated and almost continuous
failure, and without the exhibition
of irritability or loss of temper when
provocations arose at first a score of times
on every day.
</p>
<p>Of his pluck there was never the slightest
question. Again and again he would
charge, for instance, into a quickset
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
hedge when his nose told him a rat was
there, and come out a mass of thorns, and
with the rat fixed to his lip or cheek. He
would then simply knock the rat off with
a fore-paw without whimpering, and
hold it down that some one else might
come and kill it, for he seemed unable, or
unwilling, to kill anything himself.
Then, again, he habitually went straight
up to the most savage of dogs&mdash;several
times at the risk of his life, in the case of
well-known fighters twice the size of
himself&mdash;and by his manner or his charm
invariably came away harmless.
</p>
<p>He could never be made to understand&mdash;and
it is the cause of shame now
to realise the irritation that this caused
on many an occasion&mdash;that all the dogs
in the world, any more than other inhabitants
of the world, are not necessarily
our friends, or intend even to be friendly;
and that dogs, like those about them, are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
frequently in the habit of quarrelling
and rending one another without regard
to feelings, and with little of the spirit
of give and take that life and a common
lot might elsewhere be said to demand.
</p>
<p>He was often told these things, but if,
as with many of his kind, he looked as if
he understood, he never really doubted to
the end that other dogs were at least, and
of necessity, his friends. He did not
court their company. They often seemed
to bore him, and more and more the
older he grew; but he had a curious way
of inviting some to his house, and it was
no uncommon occurrence to find a
strange dog lying in the morning in the
hall that he had sometimes brought a
long distance.
</p>
<p>Of his hospitality in this way he once
gave a remarkable instance. A neighbour&#8217;s
dog was of uncertain manners, to
dogs and men alike. One evening he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
came to call. Now Murphy&#8217;s dinner was
always placed at six o&#8217;clock in one corner
of the hall, and had just been brought
when this visitor appeared. Not to be
outdone in hospitality, Murphy at once
pointed out the repast that had been
spread, and stood by while the other ate,
though he had himself had nothing since
the early morning, and could, had he
been so minded, have knocked the
stranger into the proverbial cocked hat.
All he did was to wag his tail and look
pleased, as his dinner slowly disappeared.
But, after all, such episodes as these belong
to a later period, when he had become
well-nigh human; when&mdash;it may as
well be now confessed&mdash;he came to love
the company of a man more than the
company of dogs, when confidence had
been won back, and happiness&mdash;happiness
that with those he knew and loved
showed itself in an intense and merry joy
of life&mdash;had been finally regained.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></p>
<p>One other peculiarity about him, or,
rather, accomplishment, he possessed,
must be noticed here, for, with a lifetime&#8217;s
experience of dogs, no parallel can
be recalled, or has been gatherable elsewhere.
First of all, he was certainly
musical, and often after a long day&#8217;s
work, when the landscape outside was
wintry, dreary, and wet, and the piano
was thrown open and thrashed for joy of
sound and relief, Murphy would rise
from his mat and come and lie close to
his master&#8217;s feet. He did not sing or
howl on these occasions, in the way that
with many dogs conveys the impression
that music is pain. On the contrary, he
remained quite silent, contenting himself
with a sigh and a lick of the lips,
which almost gave the impression that he
would have said, if he could, &#8220;Just play
that again, will you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>This is, however, by the way. What
he excelled in was what is generally
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
known as talking. The sound was not a
howl, or like one; it came from deep in
his throat, and was deep in tone, inflections
being produced by movements of
the jaw at the same time. To ask him a
question was generally to get an answer
in this way, though rarely out of doors,
where his attention was necessarily distracted.
But when once he had started,
he continued to respond, and so to carry
on quite a lengthy conversation. That
was his sole trick, if indeed it could be so
classed, for he evolved it entirely himself.
Of tricks proper he knew none, and
through life entirely declined to learn
any. Perhaps Dan, whose repertory was
large, had told him what a bore they
were, and cautioned him to do his utmost
to avoid them.
</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
<h2>VIII</h2>
</div>

<p>About a year after Murphy&#8217;s arrival,
Dan was gathered to his forefathers, and
there was mourning throughout the house
for many days. To one at least, if not to
more, Alphonse Karr&#8217;s remark held good&mdash;<i>On
n&#8217;a dans la vie qu&#8217;un chien</i>&mdash;and
Dan was that dog. His life had been
long; he had won all hearts; he had done
many wonderful things, besides fulfilling
his duties as a faithful constable of the
place in which his lot was cast; and now,
loving and beloved, he had died. Such
were the data from which his epitaph
had to be evolved. Man could desire no
better. To have been loved&mdash;that, all
said and done, is the great thing, for it
comprises all others. Another French
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
writer reckoned it the highest eulogy bestowable,
and it seems as if he was not
far wrong, whether we have before us
dogs or men.
</p>
<p>One of Murphy&#8217;s last acts by his
grandfather reflected his own character,
no less than the affectionate relations existing
between himself and Dan. It was
the custom to give the dogs certain biscuits
after dinner of which they were
particularly fond, and they sat side by
side to receive them. One evening, when
the biscuit tin was taken out as usual,
Dan was absent. He was old; probably
asleep: better let Murphy have his, and
have done with it. The young dog refused
to have anything to say to such
suggestions; and for the moment his attitude
was put down to an access of shyness,
for these particular biscuits were
irresistible. Presently he began barking
and running backwards and forwards to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
the door. Being let through, he ran to
another, found a third open, and presently
returned in a perfect ecstasy of delight,
with the old dog by his side. He
subsequently referred to the extraordinary
stupidity that had been evinced in
a long and comprehensive speech. To
steal a march on the old, or to fail to
treat them at all times with respect, was
evidently, in his opinion, wicked. At
least, that was his text.
</p>
<p>Dan&#8217;s last resting-place was, of course,
in the dogs&#8217; burial-ground in the family
home. To lie there was the highest honour
bestowable, and Dan had wholly
earned it. Many generations of dogs lay
in and around that corner, and the spot,
if not consecrated, was at least regarded
by most as very sacred.
</p>
<p>This was it. An angle of old, ruined
brick wall, facing West&mdash;part of an ancient
garden&mdash;beautiful in colour and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
overgrown with ivy. Great trees all
about it; and the wide stretches of a park,
where rabbits played in the long evenings,
extending from it on all sides. A
holly hedge and ha-ha prevented trespass;
but those invited there found in this
quiet sun-trap many headstones, bearing
names and dates and epitaphs. Close by,
a path, along which members of the family
went often to and fro, led to yet another
quiet corner, where a well-known
spire showed above the trees. From this
last there sounded at intervals the music
of bells, chiming, or ringing solemnly,
and beneath its shadow slept other folk,
who had once walked the world with
these same dogs of many generations,
earning epitaphs no better, if as good, as
they. To lie in either, seeing what falls
to some, might well be thought a stroke
of luck for dog or man.
</p>
<p>It was not always so for dogs, here or
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
elsewhere, whatever it may have been for
men. Within the recollection of all past
middle age, dogs were kept tied to kennels
by heavy chains, seldom allowed in
house, fed at uncertain hours, and taken
out at hours still more uncertain&mdash;if at
all. Left often to howl time away by
day, and to bark themselves to sleep at
night. And when all was over, life having
been often shortened by disease, there
came along the man with the spade, detailed
for the job, to fulfil the last of
offices, and put in some handy resting-place
the dog that had had his day.
</p>
<p>We have come out of all that now, and
rather plume ourselves upon the fact.
We have altered our opinions respecting
the proper place and surroundings of our
dogs here; and many of us are not
ashamed to confess that we hold opinions
staunchly regarding their place and surroundings
hereafter. We also have our
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
dog-doctors, our dogs&#8217; infirmaries, our
homes and charities, and, in the end, our
dogs&#8217; secluded cemeteries. Such things,
in the case of dumb animals, point, we
judge, to a higher grade of civilisation,
and to many other things besides.
</p>
<p>Yet let us not forget the fact that
others, in the past, have gone before us,
and far ahead of us, on this same track,
of which we often speak with so much
unction. In ancient Egypt dogs had
names, and these are found inscribed in
many places. They were the favourites
of the home, and constantly made much
of. They wore collars, too, and often by
no means cheap ones; and just as they
were everywhere admitted to the house,
so, all these ages ago, they were talked to,
and also made to talk. Legends were
woven about their doings and their ways.
And if, in many cases, they were small
and insignificant, with short legs like the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
Dachs, or, perhaps, the Aberdeen, implicit
trust was placed in their fidelity as
guardians of the home and family. Of
course there were bigger fellows to fulfil
the heavier duties, like the huge Kitmer,
the dog of the Seven Sleepers, whom
God allowed once to speak, and to
answer for himself and others for all
time. &#8220;I love those,&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;I love
those who are dear unto God: go
to sleep, therefore, and I will guard
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>That was sufficient, surely. Then, too,
there was Anubis, who was given a dog&#8217;s
head and a man&#8217;s body: he was worshipped
as a deity and the genius of the
Nile, who had ordered the rising of the
great river at the proper season from the
beginning of the world, and whose
doings in this way were marked by the
coming of the Dog-star, with seventy
times more power than the sun&mdash;the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
brightest of all in the purple dome of the
night.
</p>
<p>An animal such as the dog, even if
dumb, which in justice he could scarcely
be thought, was thus judged entitled to
a consideration never vouchsafed to
others, and duly received it, therefore, at
all times in this enlightened land. And
not only in the fleeting years of his existence,
but equally when he lay down
under the common hand of death. The
dog, in those forgotten days, received embalmment,
just as his master and mistress,
and was then carried with some
solemnity to the burial-ground that was
set apart for dogs in every town. And
when the last good-bye had been said,
the family to which he had belonged returned
again to their house, and put on
mourning for their friend and faithful
guardian, shaving their heads, and abstaining
for a time from food. So was it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
with dogs all those thousands of years
ago. We have not come so very far since
then.
</p>
<p>Murphy was not told many of these
latter things, though obscurantism is always
to be utterly condemned. It was
thought better that he should not know
them, or other darker facts to do with
modern scientific times, lest by chance
they give rise to strange and unorthodox
reflections in a brain so active as his.
</p>
<p>When the day came for Dan&#8217;s best
friend&mdash;she called him &#8220;Best of all&#8221;&mdash;to
set out on a journey, to see the last of
him, Murphy and his master, being left
alone, turned naturally in their talk to
the place where Dan was to be laid, as
also to the doings of many other dogs who
had lived and loved and had had the
supreme happiness of hunting there
throughout their lives. Some were good,
and others, well&mdash;not so good. Others
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
were not thought much to look at, though
this generally resolved itself into a matter
of opinion. To set against these last,
some were the very finest of their kind,
such as Ben, the great Newfoundland,
who had the glory of being painted in
company with two small members of the
family sixty or seventy years ago.
</p>
<p>Each, of course, had his characteristics,
and did his funny, or his wicked, things.
In the face of a recent occurrence, it
would have been a mistake to point a
moral, or reference might have been
made to Bruce, the deerhound, shot dead
by accident when hunting sheep at night.
That would do for another day, should
circumstances arise to give the story
point. There were plenty of other anecdotes
besides that, and here are one or
two that Murphy heard.
</p>
<p>Perhaps Fritz, the Spitz, did the
most remarkable thing of all. His master
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
was an undergraduate of Christ
Church at the time, and had been always
in the habit of taking him with him on
his return to Oxford. On a certain occasion
he decided that Fritz, for once,
should remain at home. The next day
the dog was missing. Then a letter came,
and this is what Fritz had done. He had
found his way into the neighbouring
town, distant three miles, and taken the
train to Swindon, as was duly proved.
Probably he changed there, though this
is not recorded. But he went on to Didcot,
where he certainly got out, found the
Oxford train, and that same afternoon
walked into his master&#8217;s rooms at Christ
Church.
</p>
<p>One other action of his deserves to be
recorded, for it affords an instance of
how nearly dogs approach at times to
human beings. No man is so wholly
hardened as to care to die disliked, while
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
many have a fancy ere the end to seek
forgiveness, that they themselves may die
forgiven. So was it with Fritz. Like
many men of genius, his temper was uncertain,
and on more than one occasion he
was known to bite. The day before he
died, though old and infirm, he made a
round on his own account and visited one
or two to whom he had certainly behaved
badly. His action was recalled when
once again he disappeared. But it was
further remarked upon&mdash;some adding
that they thought they understood&mdash;when
Fritz was found curled in a hole beneath
a bush&mdash;and dead.
</p>
<p>Graf, another of the same breed, but
belonging to a period twenty years later
than Fritz, had also curious ways of his
own. He could run down a rabbit in the
open, and did it on many an occasion; but
if this was remarkable&mdash;a rabbit being
reckoned one of the quickest of all animals
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
for a hundred yards&mdash;his curious
behaviour exhibited itself in quite another
way. He was a dog of great character
and cleverness, as well as perfect
manners. It was the custom in the family
at that date to have prayers on Sunday
evenings. This Graf never failed to resent.
There had been service in the
church during the day, and Sundays were
dull days for dogs: why have prayers in
the evenings to make things worse?
Therefore, to show what he felt in the
matter, no sooner had the family left the
room for prayers, than he gathered up the
newspapers and tore them deliberately to
pieces. It was not only once or twice or
even six times that he did this. He did it
repeatedly; and when the family returned,
<i>The Guardian</i> especially was
found in scraps upon the floor.
</p>
<p>But he was otherwise a good dog, and
so it was that he who read <i>The Guardian</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
week by week on Sunday evenings showed
that he bore Graf no resentment, for
when the dog died he wrote a poem running
thus, the last line and a half of
which are graven on Graf&#8217;s stone:
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin: 0 auto 0 ; '><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;Can such fidelity be all for naught?</p>

<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>In a hound&#8217;s faithful breast? No, Graf, the thought</p>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></div>
<p>By way of parodying this, in the case
of another dog, it was suggested by one
who was flippant that his epitaph might
run&mdash;&#8220;And may our lives have fewer
faults than thine.&#8221; But while it is true
that this one had run up quite a heavy
bill in cats and committed many other
enormities, the line <i>De mortuis nil nisi
bonum</i> was kept in view, and, if nothing
could be said, it was judged better to say
nothing. Moreover, as Murphy duly remarked,
while we talked over the wonderful
doings of many and many a dog
now lying in this sacred corner, &#8220;What
could you possibly have expected in such
a case, and from one of Us that you had
wilfully named Scamp?&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was, of course, something in
that, and many of Scamp&#8217;s acts deserved
to be recorded, though this is no place
for doing so. At one time he was in London.
Residence there naturally put a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
limit to the exercise of his sporting instincts,
but he developed others to replace
them. He was sometimes absent all day,
to be found at the door at night; and on
one occasion he met his master at a City
railway station, when thought to have
been lost for good and all&mdash;was indeed
seen by his master to be making his way
thither as he drove into the station yard
in question.
</p>
<p>To have done anything so clever as that
might have been thought to have earned
the right to headstone and epitaph in full.
Yet his resting-place remains unmarked,
and his name apparently dogged him to
the end, and past it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What was that about <i>De mortuis</i>?&#8221;
came the question from Murphy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Nil nisi bonum.</i>&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That never should have been raised,
in his case. What about <i>De vivis</i>?&#8221;
There was indignation in the tone; perhaps
justly.

<p>&#8220;What I does is this&mdash;what I does is,
I gets &#8217;em quite close to me, and then I
talks to &#8217;em.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This is what Mrs. Pinnix invariably
replied, when asked how it was that her
children were of such good behaviour
and gave so little trouble. And Mrs. Pinnix
knew, for she had been the careful
mother of thirteen, and had developed
this happy, good-natured method of dealing
with each in turn, boys and girls
alike. No doubt she was a remarkable
woman in many ways, for she won the
last event on the card at the time of the
Jubilee sports, being then the mother of
ten&mdash;&#8220;Skipping: open to mothers only.&#8221;
But the point here, in this remark of hers,
is that a long experience with dogs shows
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
the talking treatment to be as applicable
to them as it was to Mrs. Pinnix&#8217;s
children.
</p>
<p>Nor will this be found to be the fanciful
idea of the few, if inquiry be made.
To live largely, for instance, among those
whose labours lie far from cities, and
who, of long habit, have come to note
many things concerning which the less
fortunate townsman knows nothing, is to
learn many things oneself. To hazard
the remark in such quarters, that a good
many people have no belief in the theory
that talking to a dog does him good, is to
receive for answer, &#8220;Ah, but I knows as it
does.&#8221; Others go further, and in reply
to the question whether they think dogs&mdash;that
is, the best dogs&mdash;really understand
what is said to them, never fail to
assert with emphasis, &#8220;Well, they does;
I be sure as they does: &#8217;tisn&#8217;t a mossel o&#8217;
use to tell folks the like o&#8217; we different.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
Shepherds, stockmen, farm labourers, old
villagers who have had many experiences
though living in a narrow circle, and who
look back over a long life, constantly
make use of such remarks. And probably
dog-lovers of all classes will re-echo
the same.
</p>
<p>It was certainly the method adopted in
the further training and education of
Murphy. As already related, he had
been taught to stop when his master
stopped, and to come in when he sat or
lay down. Thus, though he was generally
allowed to range at will over the
open lands and be sometimes far distant,
in the event of the one he spent his life
with lying down to rest for a while, very
few minutes would elapse ere the dog
would be found making use of shoulder,
back, or arm as comfortable things to rest
against. Tucked closely in in this way,
his face was level with that other&#8217;s, as,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
with ears cocked and those human eyes of
his, he took stock of everything passing in
the valley, or that moved on the edges of
the great woods clothing the hill-tops.
</p>
<p>That was the time to get hold of him;
to train him not to run a hare that might
come lolloping stupidly along, down
wind, into the very jaws of danger; to
take no notice of a rabbit that offered insult
by drumming with his hind legs on
the ground only a few yards off; to tell
him strange stories of what he might expect
in the years to come when he grew
as old as his master, and had learnt to try
to take many knocks, to face many problems,
to bear and suffer much that might
come from strange quarters&mdash;had learnt
also how to live, and to reap his share of
the happiness that the mere fact of living
rarely fails to give to all who are not
weak-kneed or chicken-hearted.
</p>
<p>Of course experience, in some ways,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
tended to undermine confidence. Did
he not know all about that himself? Had
he not at one time come to doubt all
things human? Had not happiness and
trust and faith gone by the board, because
of the hardness and injustice meted out
to him? But what now? By some miraculous
process there had come a
change. Doubt had not altogether vanished;
confidence had not altogether returned;
faith and trust in the giants that
stalked over the world, and who seemed
to rule it, were not as yet quite re-established:
perhaps they never could, or
would be. To some natures recovery in
such directions is impossible. The fire
has seared, the cicatrice remains&mdash;though
to be hidden away, of course. To show
feelings&mdash;above all, to show you are hurt&mdash;to
sing out, in fact&mdash;is to exhibit a poor
spirit, to fall short in proper doggedness.
Suffer in silence, if you can&mdash;that must
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
be the rule; just as this dog, with his
keen, eager face, loves in silence&mdash;loves
all the more deeply, perchance, because he
loves in silence, and because that silence
is so much more eloquent than words.
</p>
<p>Did Murphy understand? According
to Job Nutt, the shepherd, who was a
philosopher in his way, &#8220;of course he did&mdash;he
know&#8217;d he did: his&#8217;n did; for why
not your&#8217;n?&#8221; In the face of such definite
assertion there was no room for doubt.
</p>
<p>Nutt had had his lambing-pens, that
year, down in the hollow where there was
&#8220;burra&#8221; from the winds. It was snowing
when the hurdles and the straw were
carted out, and all hands had set to work
building the sides of the great square,
with their thick, straw walls, their straw
roofs, the snug divisions into which the
sides were divided, the whole sloping to
the south to catch what might be of the
pale, wintry sun. Every one knew that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
sheep lambed quicker and earlier when
the snow fell. There had been no time to
lose therefore. The first lambs would be
heard a fortnight before Christmas.
And, as a matter of fact, by mid January,
Job Nutt&#8217;s family already numbered
sixty-three. That was of course nothing.
Why, one January, his father had had
one hundred and fifty-one lambs born
between a Saturday morning at light and
Monday, no fewer than forty-two being
doubles&mdash;and snow falling all the time.
Ay, and when he moved his hurdles&mdash;that
is, those that were straw-wattled&mdash;they
were caked so hard with snow that
they stood upright of themselves. His
father &#8220;had had to work <i>some</i> that day
and them two night.&#8221; And Job always
grinned a merry grin when he told the
story.
</p>
<p>But now, to-day, when the two who
were always together dropped down from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
the hill to pay a visit to this shepherd, it
was the last week of February, when the
mornings are as brilliant and full of hope
as any in the year. The rooks were busy
building in the great elms by the river;
the wattles just below the lambing-pens
were already turning red. Spring was
coming: the colour of the sky, the voices
of the larks, the bleat of the lambs, all
told the same story. Of course winter
would return: it always did. But, for the
moment, there was a passing exhibition of
beauties in store, a reflection of things
that should be. By the afternoon the
grey blinds would be down again. But
that did not matter in the least: this
glimpse had been permitted, and in the
brilliant sunlight and the stillness the
happiness of full confidence had welled
up, and seemed to fill the whole world.
</p>
<p>Murphy certainly appeared to feel it.
As he and his master sunk the hill, he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
stretched himself out as he ran; he
jumped into the air for joy. His doings,
in some mysterious way, frequently reflected
the colour of the day; and his
spirits varied with those of his master.
The sympathy of dogs is no modern discovery,
but as old as their comradeship
with man; and thus this one varied his
ways according as times were good or
bad, or trials, mental or bodily, chanced
to be the same. On this brilliant morning
man and dog had caught the light of the
sun and the gladness thereof, and the
young dog played with his master&#8217;s hand
as he swung along, and barked and
jumped for very love of life.
</p>
<p>He was often like this now when they
were alone together, though, with others,
he would sometimes lapse again into uncertainty
and hesitation. Nevertheless,
there was no longer doubt that he was on
the right road: happiness had in a large
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
measure returned; confidence was following.
The man and the dog were drawing
very close to one another, and in more
ways than one.
</p>
<p>The pens were only tenanted now by
some thirty ewes, still to lamb, and by
those &#8220;in hospital,&#8221; as Job spoke of them.
Four hundred tegs, ewes, and lambs were
in fold on the hill, on a clover stubble, or
what remained of it, being given crushed
swedes and other things, for keep was
scarce so early in the year. The shepherd&#8217;s
boy and his dog were up there
with them: only Job and Scot were in the
pens. Murphy knew this last, savage
though he was; and had duly delivered
to him, on many a previous occasion, that
strange message of his that compelled the
most savage to let him pass free.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! he can come: I likes that dog o&#8217;
your&#8217;n,&#8221; called Job, ordering Scot to his
place beneath the bleached and weather-worn
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
hut on wheels, in which all the miscellaneous
articles of a shepherd&#8217;s craft
lay stored. &#8220;I be just about to find that
mother yonder a new child,&#8221; he added,
with his usual grin. He was busy tying
the skin of a dead lamb on to the back of
another&mdash;dressing him up, in fact, in another
suit, even as Rebecca once did
Jacob.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When a yo do lose her lamb, we&#8217;s
careful to leave the dead un next its
mother, for they&#8217;ve got hearts same as we.
If us was to go for to take the lamb, they
&#8217;ould pine. &#8217;Tis nat&#8217;ral, ain&#8217;t it? Well,
you see, &#8217;tis like this. After a bit we
takes a lamb from a yo as has a double,
like this un here; skins the dead lamb;
and ties the skin round t&#8217;other&#8217;s neck,
same as this&mdash;see? She&#8217;ll let this un suck
then; but she &#8217;ouldn&#8217;t afore&mdash;no fear!
They do know their own childern, same
as we; just as they knows them as tends
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
&#8217;em. By-and-by I&#8217;ll cut this skin away,
bit by bit, when I judges this un has got
to smell same as her own child: it&#8217;ll be
all right then. Ah! &#8217;tis like this with
sheep&mdash;there&#8217;s something to be learnt
about they every time in the day as one
comes nigh &#8217;em.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So the two men rested against the
hurdles in the sun, and Murphy sat
solemnly between them: he had become
very particular in his manners when with
sheep. The disguised lamb was already
sucking the ewe; and Job lit his short clay
pipe and smiled: he had been up all
night.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d never have a lamb killed, if it was
my way; no&#8217;r I wouldn&#8217;t. Do you minds
last season, when you and yer dog was
along? I wus a-going across the Dene
with a bottle o&#8217; warm milk, with a bit of
a tube stuck in it, if you minds. &#8217;Twas
warm milk I&#8217;d taken from the cow. Ah,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
well, &#8217;twas for a lamb as had lost its
mother: udder wrong; I could find of it
when the master brought the lot in. And
I goes for to say as any un as &#8217;ud serve a
yo that way should be crucified. Well,
&#8217;tis that very lamb as was as is now the
yo a-suckling the one we dressed up. See
how things do work round, don&#8217;t &#8217;em?&#8221;
</p>
<p>But the talk was not always about
sheep, when the folds or the pens were
visited, or &#8220;Him and his dog&#8221; walked
with Nutt and other shepherds over the
open lands, in the wind and the weather.
</p>
<p>One day Job had been busy sheepwashing,
and the talk turned on dogs, as
it often did.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis wonderful what they knows.
What don&#8217;t &#8217;em know? I says. See that
Scot I had&mdash;the one afore this un. Well,
I was down a-sheepwashing, same as I&#8217;ve
been just. One o&#8217; the full-mouthed
sheep as we had then broke away, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
went straight over river, and it ain&#8217;t very
narrow there, as you minds. She got up
on the further bank and stud. And Scot,
he looks at me, and across at the sheep,
and then at me again. I know&#8217;d, right
enough, what he wanted. He wanted to
go over and fetch that sheep back. But
I &#8217;ouldn&#8217;t let un, for a bit. And he kept
a-looking and a-looking, same as any one
might speak. So I just moved my head,
like; there was no call to do no more.
And off he set in the water, and swam
river, ketched the sheep by the throat&mdash;oh,
no, he didn&#8217;t hurt un, no fear!&mdash;dragged
un to the bank, and brought
un over, right enough: he did,
though.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, &#8217;twas like this,&#8221; he continued,
after a laugh. &#8220;A gen&#8217;leman was a-rowing
by in a boat at the time. And he
comes across to our side, when he sees
what Scot &#8216;a&#8217; done, and he says, &#8216;Shepherd,&#8217;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
he says, &#8216;I&#8217;ll have that dog off you,
if you&#8217;ve a mind.&#8217; And with that he puts
three golden sovereigns on the bank at my
feet, where we was busy a-sheepwashing.
So I looks at the sovereigns, and then at
he, and says to un, with a laugh&mdash;I says,
&#8216;<i>No Sir</i>.&#8217; Lord, how he did pray me to
let un have that dog!
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it come about this way. That
evening we was a-coming down through
the village, and passed &#8216;The Crown&#8217;&mdash;that
was, Scot and me&mdash;and there stood
the same gen&#8217;leman at the door. So he
comes across the road, seeing me, and he
says, &#8216;Well, shepherd,&#8217; he says, &#8216;will you
part with the dog now, for, if so be as
you will, I&#8217;ll make it five instead of
three?&#8217; he says. And that&#8217;s truth. And
I just looked he between the eyes, like,
and says, &#8216;Part with my dog, Sir?&#8217; I says.
&#8216;Why, Sir, if I wus to part with he, I&#8217;ll
tell ye what he&#8217;d do&mdash;he&#8217;d pine and die&mdash;he&#8217;d
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
just pine away and die.&#8217; And with
that I passed on, and left un. Dogs&mdash;well,
sheep, if you do please to understand,
is sheep; but dogs is dogs, and God
Almighty do know as they be wonderful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not all dogs, though, that are as
shepherds&#8217; dogs, Nutt&mdash;or capable of
being.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nutt shook his head. The two men
and their dogs were on the hillside, with
two hundred and fifty tegs moving before
them. The sheep were walking with a
wide front, but in single files, following
those parallel tracks that had marked
this steep hillside for centuries, to puzzle
strangers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t make a shepherd&#8217;s dog out
of every dog, can you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps not, in your meaning. But I
do know I could train a&#8217;most any dog,
if as I&#8217;d be so minded.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></p>
<p>Scot was on ahead, where he should be.
Murphy was close to heel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean to say you could train
this one to fold sheep?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Job Nutt took a deep draw at his pipe,
and turned and looked down at Murphy,
now just over three years old.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I likes that dog; well, I&#8217;ve allus liked
un. Train un to sheep? I believe as I
could, were I to be so minded: I do believe
as I could.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The two had to part then. It was dusk,
and looked like wet; moreover, some
wether sheep in the fold, far down in the
valley, were &#8220;howling&#8221; for rain: they
were true weather-prophets always.
</p>
<p>So he might be trained to sheep. Job
Nutt&#8217;s words kept repeating themselves
in the mind&mdash;&#8220;I believe as I could; I do
believe as I could.&#8221; What the shepherd
had said was a testimony to this dog&#8217;s
marvellous intelligence; but then every
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
one had come to testify to that and to remark
upon it. He was of course nervous
and shy, and no doubt would always be
so. Perhaps it was these characteristics
that gave him the further one of extraordinary
gentleness, that won all hearts.
Many had already said, with a laugh,
that he was &#8220;born good&#8221;; but latterly
some had come to add that he was incapable
of harm or ill.
</p>
<p>And yet with these characteristics,
amounting as they did to a certain softness,
there was never any question of his
pluck and spirit. Nor was there any
limit to it. He had the spirit and &#8220;go&#8221;
of any dozen of his countrymen: what
more could possibly be said? At the
same time he had the gentleness of a
child. He recalled to mind one of those
characters that some of us have met, and
in strange situations&mdash;situations and
hours when men&#8217;s spirits were on fire, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
when the air was filled with sounds that
once to hear is never to forget. One such
is recalled by memory now&mdash;a vision of
a lithe and active figure that had come its
longest marches, and borne the many
hardships of the many nights and days,
though looking frail as a girl in her teens,
and with manner always gentle as a child.
For one like that to be amidst such doings
as these seemed incongruous. Yet had
the estimate proved in the end quite false.
Breeding and pluck&mdash;nervous energy&mdash;had
carried through, when others had
gone down. And the pluck and the
breeding showed itself still, when the
blood dripped, and ebbed away, and the
face was white as a stone.
</p>
<p>Nor is such a parallel as far fetched as
might at first appear. Given the two, the
dog and the man, this dog was to show
before the end characteristics equally
striking and of scarcely less charm. To
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
bear pain is not easy. There is no longer
doubt that men feel pain in varying degrees,
and that sufferings that might be
considered identical are multiplied tenfold
in the case of a highly developed organisation.
With the high intelligence
and nervous development of this dog, it
might have been thought that pain would
terrify. If so, he never showed it.
</p>
<p>It is unnecessary here to refer to the
many instances when his dash and high
spirit brought about an accident, for all
our dogs get into trouble and meet with
accidents at times&mdash;at least, those of any
worth. But it was this dog&#8217;s further
habit to avoid, when in pain, the company
of the one he loved best, and to go
invariably to a woman for aid. It was as
much as to say that he knew that many
men were in such cases worse than useless:
a thrust in this instance not without
its truth. Thus he came home two miles
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
one night in snow, with both fore-feet cut
right across with glass&mdash;due to a dash at
a rat in some rushes on the frozen riverbank.
To his master&#8217;s eternal shame he
never found it out. But, on arriving
home, this dog went straight off for attention,
of his own accord, and bore what
he had to bear, not only without a flinch,
but showing his gratitude by licking the
hand that was tending him. So again,
when he was once badly stubbed, he went
to the same quarter, showed his foot, and
then lay down, staying perfectly quiet
while a spike was looked for, at last
found, and then pulled out with a pair of
iron pincers.
</p>
<p>These are trivialities, no doubt; but
they would not be trivialities to some of
Us. It is by such that character shows
itself&mdash;is moulded and made up&mdash;for
others to estimate and take due note of.
And thus it is that whether they are exhibited
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
by man or animal, we admit their
charm and pay our tribute to them, just
as Theron&#8217;s faithfulness to Roderick
drew these words from the lips of the
aged Severian:

<p>The hay harvest had been a light one,
owing to the weather in the spring and
the absence of wet. It was hardly off the
ground before the corn harvest had begun
and the long arms of the self-binder were
to be seen waving in the air above the
standing oats, the first of all, this season,
to go down. &#8220;The moon had come in on
dry earth,&#8221; as the harvesters expressed
it; and with implicit faith in the moon,
there would therefore be no rain. For
once in a way faith was not misplaced:
there was great heat, which ripened
wheat and oats and barley too quickly,
left the straw short, and covered the turnips
with fly.
</p>
<p>It was too hot in the day to go far&mdash;that
is, for those in life who can choose
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
their own time. So the dog and the man
took their walks late, and prolonged them
to the hour when the ruddy moon rose
solemnly into the sky over the woods and
set out on its low, summer curve to the
west. Daylight lasted long after the sun
went down: a hot glow spread gradually
northward, and what with the light in
this direction and the moon at full, only
those two other worlds, Jupiter and
Venus, were visible in the cloudless vault
above. This was the time of day to be
abroad, but, oddly enough, the hour
when many were indoors. There was
some excuse for the harvesters. They
had been up with the sun: by half-past
seven it was time to put the self-binder
to bed in the field; by eight, or soon after,
many were in bed themselves. Men and
horses had sweated much, and had had a
long day.
</p>
<p>It was on an evening such as this that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
Murphy had his first lesson in working to
the hand, for Job&#8217;s remark had given rise
to a train of thought. Education was of
course everything. Those who lived on
the land should be educated in the things
of the land; should learn, if not its deeper
wonders and mysteries, at least its simple
lessons and what lay at the back of these.
It was in these fields and over these
breezy downs that thews and sinews were
to be braced, health and strength gathered,
souls cleansed, if so be that the ways
of the man were straight and true.
</p>
<p>Here was God&#8217;s work always visible,
from the wonders of the growth of the
seeds to the coming of the music of
the rains that washed the air and made
the land sing with life. Here was always
visible the infinite power of small things,
beauty unstained, Nature&#8217;s laws always in
full operation&mdash;the triumph of good
work, the smothering of that which was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
ill. Here in these very fields had been
gathered the strength of arm that had
stood the country in good stead, when the
drums beat and true men were wanted
beyond seas. That seemed to be more as
it should be. And so it may be yet&mdash;that
is, when the craze of a day has passed,
and the men of the land come back.
</p>
<p>Education would do it. Some hearts
would be bitten with the old love, and
learn to forget the new. But the education
must be true and not false, in tune
with the life that shall be; not cramped
and with little connection between it and
the field of labour that lies ahead. Uniformity
is often but to bring down to one
dead level, to crush true liberty and freedom,
to force unnatural growth, and to
give this a trend untrue. Education on
such lines seems curiously false to many
minds, as well as stultifying.
</p>
<p>Scot, who had no appearance of a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
sheep-dog&mdash;that is, as his class are generally
portrayed in coloured prints&mdash;might
possibly have been brought up as
a water-spaniel, or he might have been
the darling of a semi-detached villa and
have learnt to walk drab, unlovely streets
without endangering his life: it is all a
matter of education, fortified by environment.
As it was, he was brought up with
a cottage for a home and learnt the mysteries
of sheep, the tending and the care
of them, what the stretching of limbs
meant, no less than freedom and free air.
</p>
<p>The life was a hard one, no doubt, in
one sense. Sometimes there were short
commons: there was much bad weather
to be faced, when his master was clad in
strange clothes and wore a sack like the
hood of a monk over the top of his
weather-worn cap, and he himself was
glad to get to the shelter of the hut, where
the stove was burning: there was the wet,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
when all alike were mud-smothered:
there were the biting winds of March.
But there came the glad spring and the
long summer days; the one gave a flavour
to the other and created a love for both,
and deep down in the heart where that
love burnt bright was the pride of his
calling, the honour of tending sheep.
Soft jobs were not for men&mdash;or manly
dogs.
</p>
<p>Of course Murphy could not be a
sheep-dog; that is, unless Job Nutt had
a mind to make him. Then, of course, he
would have had a proper schoolmaster,
and been brought up to things among
which he had been born and bred, while
lookers-on beheld a novel kind of sheep-dog.
As it was, however, his master
owned no sheep. Yet, seeing that his lot
had not been that of some&mdash;to walk the
streets for exercise, or to lie in the
cramped garden of a villa in a town&mdash;it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
was only right he should learn all that
he could, and that his education should
partake of the fields and the upland
downs around his home.
</p>
<p>As to whether it would have been possible
to have trained him to the streets at
all must now be left among the things unknown.
The impression remains that,
seeing he never grasped the desperate
dangers of the modern road, his life, had
he been so foolish as to forsake the country
for the town, would probably have
been limited to hours. For a better, freer
life he was fortunately born, and he certainly
never threw this chance away, but
made the very most of it, and came to
great happiness thereby.
</p>
<p>Of course it took time; but a beginning
was made in those halcyon, summer days,
and the art of working by the hand gradually
brought to some perfection. No
little of this dog&#8217;s gladness in life was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
centred eventually in this accomplishment,
and he was never happier than
when at practice. The education began
by teaching him to lie down at the command&mdash;&#8220;Stop
there,&#8221; and then in leaving
him behind for gradually lengthening
periods. So well did he know these
words, that he would act on them instantly,
and in this way once lost his walk
by a slight misunderstanding. An explanation
of the method was being given
one day, when walking with a friend.
The opening words were of course used.
Some time after the dog was missed, and
it was not until steps had been retraced
for a considerable distance that he was
found, lying where he had first heard the
words and looking a little shy.
</p>
<p>The next proceeding was to start him,
and then to stop him, till by degrees he
came to understand the movement of the
hands or arms. In this way it was possible
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
to send him to great distances, or
move him to right or left, much after the
manner in which we who are soldiers
move our men. When a hand was uplifted
high, he would drop at once, so
that nobody would think that there was
a dog within a mile: he might be lying in
rough grass where the ragwort was high,
or the wheat, as they say, was proud, and
be himself invisible. But he could see
well enough with those bright eyes of his,
and the moment the arm was waved he
was off with a stride of two yards or
more, circling round and making the valley
ring to his glad bark. He always
entered into the whole fun of the thing,
and looked upon it as the finest game that
had ever been invented.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, well,&#8221; remarked Job as he
watched, and Scot gave tongue for very
jealousy&mdash;&#8220;ah, well, I allus liked that
dog.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></p>
<p>And so did every one.
</p>
<p>With each little addition to the sum
of knowledge he possessed, master and
dog grew closer to one another. It
is always a moot point whether our dogs
consider they belong to the family with
which they live, or whether they do not
regard the matter the other way about,
and judge that the family belongs to
them. In Murphy&#8217;s case there is no
shadow of doubt that, so far as his master
was concerned, that master most certainly
belonged to him. At first, the position
had been different. There was reason for
that. But even the reason had now apparently
passed out of mind: injustice
had doubtless been forgiven, and what
was far more wonderful&mdash;or rather,
would have been, had man been in the
case and not a dog&mdash;had also, so far as
could be seen, been totally forgotten.
</p>
<p>So completely had confidence been
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
won that anything was permitted, even to
the playful brandishing of a stick. Sticks
were things to play with. They had no
relation to punishment at all. Besides,
was not life a state to be enjoyed, and as
happy as the day was long? And had he
not taught his one great friend no end of
facts of which he had hitherto been desperately
ignorant?
</p>
<p>It was all very well for Him to say
that he had educated and trained this
dog. The dog had all the while been
training Him. It was all very well for
Him to think in his heart that he had
given this dog happiness in life. Happiness
had in a measure also come back
to Him. There had been, in more than
one direction, a strange parallel between
their cases, and as this had made itself
felt, it had bound them both more closely
together. They were now not only never
apart, but they were of one mind in other
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
ways as well&mdash;in joy of life as they found
it under the sky; in the happiness of comradeship
as they learnt to rely on it&mdash;indoors
and out; in the deeper meaning of
friendship, with the trust and undeviating
truth that friendship claims; in the
faith that the one had always in the
other, through the good days and the
hard.
</p>
<p>Those who watched were often overheard
to say, &#8220;The dog has taken charge
of the man.&#8221; And so he had, to a certain
degree. He had learnt his master&#8217;s
habits exactly. He knew the time of day
by the striking of the clock; and, morning
after morning, at a particular hour, if
this master, with his funny ways, delayed
his going, he would get up from his familiar
corner and come and stand and fix
him with his eyes. Or, if this failed,
would come, gently, closer, and lay his
chin upon a knee, and make him lay
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
down his work and come out for the
regulation interval. In the longer
marches of old days, there were halts in
every hour. Come out! Come out!
New strength and new ideas are to be
gathered outside; you will grow stale in
here, whether you choose to practise this
art or that. Houses are well enough to
sleep in and to give shelter; but it is the
heavens that give strength, and it is God&#8217;s
heaven that somehow, if only feebly,
must get itself reflected in man&#8217;s work.
</p>
<p>So, in another instant, these two would
be out together; the one going as far as
tether would allow; the other doing what
was yet another of his joys in life, and
that caused such fun and merriment to
lookers-on&mdash;the hunting of birds. Of
that he never tired on the longest or the
hottest day. Blackbirds gave the finest
sport of all, as they generally flew only
three feet above the ground. He knew
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
their note at once; but probably the laugh
of the green woodpecker vexed him more
than most, while he certainly regarded
the mocking notes of cuckoos as insults
to himself. Of birds of various kinds he
caught many, young and old, but was
never known to hurt a single one.
</p>
<p>The most remarkable of his exploits in
this direction was when he found himself
at one time by the sea. It was a lonely
coast, where great crimson cliffs rose
sheer out of the sand, their ledges, here
and there, covered with tamarisk, gorse,
and shaven thorn&mdash;right to their very
summit three hundred feet above, from
whence the moors stretched far away inland.
A heavy surf beat there at times,
setting these cliffs echoing in such a way
as to make speech difficult. On these
wild days it was well that this dog had
learnt to work so perfectly by hand, for
he had no fear of the rollers, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
wonder was that he escaped from being
drowned.
</p>
<p>At the bottom of the whole fun of
this new situation lay the fact that these
cliffs were inhabited by innumerable
gulls. To catch one of these was Murphy&#8217;s
aim, and often was he washed out
on to the sands in a smother of spindrift,
in his mad eagerness to attain his end.
The herring-gulls were the finest sport of
all, with their constant melancholy cries&mdash;&#8220;pew-il,&#8221;
&#8220;pee-ole,&#8221; or their hoarser
note of warning, &#8220;kak-k-kak&#8221;; their bodies
two feet in length; their spread of
wing no less than four feet four. For
months he chased them, till at last some
must possibly have known him. It was
perhaps on this account that one of them
was not quick enough in getting under
way on one occasion. Murphy flung
himself into the air and got him; and
not only got him, but brought him along,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
with the great wings beating the air about
him, so that the dog was scarcely visible
for the bird. It was the old story again,
of the hare in his earlier days, for the
gull was not harmed, and when liberated
flew out to sea, with the cry &#8220;pew-il,&#8221;
&#8220;pee-ole&#8221; flung back from the waves as
he went.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never thought to live tu zee the like
o&#8217; that,&#8221; remarked a longshoreman passing
at the time: but then he was a stranger
to Murphy, and also to his ways.
</p>
<p>What happiness was to be had in life;
what sport and splendid fun&mdash;sport all
day long; fun without end! Did not the
morning begin with a game?&mdash;the dog
lying down in one corner of the hall, fixing
his master with his eye as he appeared,
and then, after pausing a while
as if to say, &#8220;Are you ready?&#8221; launching
himself full tilt, till he was brought up
in a final leap against his master&#8217;s chest,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
full five feet from the ground. Of course
the whole hall was in a smother every
time, with mats and rugs all out of place
upon the slippery floor. And then the
noise! The only thing was to leave the
house and work off some of the steam out
there.
</p>
<p>No dog with a particle of nervousness
or hesitation left would do such things as
that. But he only did them with his master.
When with others, report had it that
he was a different dog, with no taste for
hunting or for chasing birds&mdash;a dog, in
fact, that invariably got into one room
and lay there alone, unless he changed his
place for the mat by the front door.
</p>
<p>Of course He would come back. Folk
always did. There could be no break in
this friendship: it would last for ever.
He had heard his master count the years:
&#8220;Four&#8221;&mdash;that was his own age&mdash;he knew
that much; and from four his master
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
would count up to ten; then hesitate; then
say &#8220;eleven&#8221;; then hesitate again, and remark,
&#8220;twelve&mdash;perhaps: yes, little man;
you&#8217;ll see me out&mdash;easy!&#8221;
</p>
<p>And those who watched and looked on
added this to what they had said before,
&#8220;What <i>will</i> happen, if anything happens
to that dog?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was a funny way of putting it, but
the remark was always met, in reply,
with, &#8220;Don&#8217;t let us meet trouble half-way,
or make a circuit of the hills to look
for it;

<h2>XI</h2>
</div>

<p>The roads were deep in snow. The fall
had begun two hours before light; gently,
and with large flakes&mdash;the presage of
what was to come. Snow was still falling
in the afternoon; but now the wind had
sprung up, and each large flake was torn
into a dozen as the wind played with
them, driving them upwards like dust,
then catching them and sending them
horizontally and at speed over the
ground, till they could find a resting-place
in some drift that was forming on
the north sides of fences, or peace beneath
the brambles of some ditch.
</p>
<p>An hour or more before dark the wind
increased, and was blowing a whole gale.
What fun to be out in that: come on!
</p>
<p>It was not long before man and dog
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
were away. The roads would be safe on
such a day as this; so, for once, the two
trudged along till they overtook two
waggons. How big they looked in the
smother, each with its team of three&mdash;a
pair in the shafts, and one more ahead
as leader. Talking was difficult, or well-nigh
impossible; but at least they could
join the men, and shout a word or two
at times.
</p>
<p>On the weather side the great horses
looked twice their size, plastered as they
were with snow, their manes and the hair
about their huge feet all matted with ice.
But on the lee they looked different animals,
for their coats were darkened, being
drenched with sweat: it was with difficulty
that they kept their feet, and their
breath came heavily through their nostrils
as they struggled on.
</p>
<p>Not that they had a heavy load to
draw. The waggons were empty. They
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
had come in with a full load in the morning,
intending to bring coal back. &#8220;But
how was &#8217;em to do that, in weather the
like of this; or on roads same as these
here? Nay, nay,&#8221; shouted the rearmost
carter, &#8220;we&#8217;s for getting home, empty or
somehow, if so be as these here can keep
their feets. The road below the snow is
ice, I tell ye&mdash;just ice; and, what&#8217;s more,
Fiddlehill lies just ahead for we.&#8221; The
last words were punctuated with the
crack of a whip like a pistol-shot: all talk
was dropped after that for a while; the
wind was growing fiercer.
</p>
<p>Both waggons were painted yellow,
picked out with scarlet; but the paint that
had looked brilliant in the sun of the
harvest days looked tawdry and dirty
now against the snow, and every patch or
scar of rough usage was easily discernible.
Now and then the wind came with a savage
gust, carrying stray straws out of one
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
of the waggons, though snow was collecting
on the floor: on the other, the cords
of a tarpaulin, indifferently secured, were
smacking the yellow sides like a lash.
Some of these sounds did not suit
Murphy very well; but he had found out
the best and safest place, and was making
his way as well as he could, sheltered beneath
the rearmost waggon and between
the tall hind wheels, whose rims and
spokes and hubs were hung and bespattered,
like all else, with snow.
</p>
<p>It was true that he looked like some
other person&#8217;s dog, with a white face and
whiskers. But his master was white, too,
from head to foot; what recked it!
</p>
<p>In another hour or less darkness would
have shut down on the world, though
such a term as darkness was only relative
on a day when it could never have
been said to have been light.
</p>
<p>When the open was reached, the snow,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
broken into hard flakes, whipped face
and ears like nettles. Murphy was the
best off of the party, save when something
had drawn him from beneath the waggon,
and he was having a game with the snow
on his own account. Great wreaths hung
to the fences, or stood out in ledges where
the banks were high. The sky, or rather
the whole air, was lead colour, and all
distance was blotted out. Flocks of
crazy, distracted birds flew close by in
great numbers, for the most part finches
and larks, with here and there a fieldfare
or two, their breasts and underwings buff
colour. Then came a flight wholly made
up of buntings, whose brilliant yellows
looked deep orange against the leaden
grey that shrouded all.
</p>
<p>There was no end to the great host.
They were all going one way: they made
no sound but the swish of wings, and uttered
no single note: they passed at speed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
as though in fear, yet all the while in
obedience to the supremest law of all.
To the southward there would be protection;
life there would be preserved: here
it was impossible&mdash;for birds. &#8220;Keep low;
press on!&#8221; Victory shall be to the strongest:
the weak shall fall in this pitiless
wind, and the snow shall cover the dead,
but in the end there shall be a better life
for some. &#8220;Keep low; press on!&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was something weird in such a
sight as that: there was something weird
also in the sound of the wind. It came
sweeping over the fields, tearing with
angry gusts at the snow-laden briars in
the fences, and passing on with a moaning
sound into the dark of the approaching
night.
</p>
<p>There was no sign of human beings
anywhere. Familiar objects had all
changed their character, though it was
only by these that whereabouts could be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
told. The remains of a hay-rick by the
roadside suddenly showed up out of the
mirk, with white top like some great
ghost, its blackened sides flecked here and
there with snow. In the hot days of
June two here had seen it built; and,
later on, watched the trussers at work on
it, when the price of hay had gone up,
and farmers could make a few pounds.
But that job, like most others, had had to
be abandoned now.
</p>
<p>Why, here was the great stoggle oak
by the pool, on whose limbs in former
times, tradition had it, many a highwayman
had swung! The storm to it was
nothing: it had weathered so many: the
world was a fair place; but life was full
of tests as well as trials. &#8220;Heads up!
Bear yourselves like men,&#8221; its limbs
seemed to roar in solemn, deep diapason.
&#8220;Heads up!&mdash;there is a haven for all
ahead!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span></p>
<p>It was fifty yards further on before the
voice of the oak was lost. But as man
and dog worked further still, for very joy
of the wind and the snow and love for
the elements at their worst&mdash;the horses
struggling, the waggoners calling to them
loudly and urging them to put their best
into it, with many a crack of the whip&mdash;there
suddenly fell a lull, and for a moment
there was peace. And just then,
up from the valley, there came other
sounds&mdash;the larch and the firs down
there were sighing out a tune to
themselves, being partly sheltered by the
hill.
</p>
<p>It was time to turn back. There was a
lane in the direction of those last sounds:
home could easily be reached that way,
and, likely enough, with the set of the
wind, the roadway itself would have been
swept almost bare.
</p>
<p>The waggons were lost to sight in a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
moment, though the woody rattle of the
axles could still be heard: snow was falling
heavily again: the cold was becoming
intense: the wind was now dropping altogether.
A dead bird or two were
passed, lying in the snow, claws in air
and already stiff: a felt and a yellowhammer
were side by side at the bottom
of the hill. It was like the dead in gay
uniforms, lying scattered after an action.
A little further on there was a blackbird,
to Murphy&#8217;s very evident glee. He
found it at once, and was for carrying it
home; it was still warm. But this was
no time for fooling. It was already dark
and growing darker; the proper thing to
do was to keep together and make for
home. Travelling was none too easy,
even for tall men, and really difficult for
dogs in places.
</p>
<p>At points where field gates opened on
to the road, drifts had formed two feet
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
in depth, right across the way, and it was
necessary to pick up the dog and carry
him, though to the latter&#8217;s thinking that
was a silly thing to do. Time was, when
his master had had to do that; but he had
then been no better than a child in arms.
Now he was a man, and had come to
man&#8217;s estate, and, furthermore, had learnt
what life was, with its hours full of
health, and crammed with fresh adventures
and experiences, as, of course, it
should be. His muscles were hard and
flexible as steel, his heart strong with life,
his brain quick to learn whatsoever his
master thought best that he should know.
Health, strength, what happiness it all
was! The neighbourhood of those waggons
had been rather depressing, and the
crack of those whips somewhat disconcerting;
but he did not stop to reason
why. It was enough that he and his master
were together. The past might look
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
after itself, and so might the future; this
was the all-sufficient present.
</p>
<p>A deep silence reigned in the valley;
even the larch and the firs had given up
their songs. There was the scrunch of
the foot at each step, and now and then
a rustle in the hedge, as a bramble became
overweighted with snow and dislodged
its load into the ditch, or last
year&#8217;s leaves, still clinging to some oak,
rustled and were still again. Otherwise
the world was dead or asleep; it made
little difference which.
</p>
<p>A cottage was passed further on, and a
chink of light from a candle within
showed that the snowflakes were still falling
fast. This way would be impassable
by morning. At the turn of the lane
voices were heard. They were some way
off; but it was easy to recognise that they
were those of two men talking. Presently
the voices became more audible.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
It was too dark to see who the men were
as they passed: at night, when snow is
falling, those met are up and gone by almost
before their approach is realised.
There was just time for a &#8220;Good-night,&#8221;
with a &#8220;Good-night to you, Sir,&#8221; in reply.
</p>
<p>For an instant there was silence: then
the men began talking again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless the Lord!&mdash;did you see who that
was, Tom, and on such a night as this!&#8221;
remarked one.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know as I know&#8217;d un.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not know un?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, bless the life on yer&mdash;that&#8217;s
Him an&#8217; his dog!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There, was it now? Him an&#8217; his dog,
for sure. Carrying un, wus he? Like
un.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah&mdash;allus together, ain&#8217;t &#8217;em?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For his part, he don&#8217;t seem to have
much else.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It would be well to get on, and not to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
stand there gaping into the darkness, listening
to what you were never meant to
hear. The truth of the old saying generally
holds good; and sometimes words
accidentally overheard in such ways are
fixed in the mind for life. These last
were like a stab.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t seem to have much else?&#8221; What
did the fellow mean? How invariably
lookers-on misjudged! What a mistake
it was to pass judgment at all&mdash;on anything
or anybody!
</p>
<p>&#8220;... Much else ... much else...?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The road was less deeply covered here.
The dog was heavy: a few yards more
and he was put down. As the journey
was resumed, he took to playing in the
darkness, and, in his winning and affectionate
way, with the fingers of his master&#8217;s
hand, as much as to say, &#8220;Thank
you: we are together; the rest matters
little.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Him and his dog ... much else ...
much else...?&#8221; The words kept time
with the footfall.
</p>
<p>How dark it was!
</p>
<p>And cold&mdash;the thermometer marked
minus 1°.

<h2>XII</h2>
</div>

<p>A summer night, and the heat the heat
of the dog-days. The tramcars had
stopped running long ago; the streets
were quite deserted.
</p>
<p>Not long since, the clock set high in
the tower of St. Giles&#8217; had chimed three-quarters;
and now it chimed the hour,
and wearily struck &#8220;Two.&#8221; Then other
clocks also awoke to their duties, and, not
possessing chimes, repeated the latter
information in various keys, from far and
near. It was all very sombre; and the
smell of the streets very unlovely.
</p>
<p>It was Bill&#8217;s turn to be up that night;
at least, they said it was his turn. As a
matter of fact, he had been up three
nights running, and at least ten in the
last eighteen, for this was no ordinary
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
case, and the credit of the firm was at
stake. Not that he held the dignity of
being a member, much less a partner, of
the firm; but he had worked for it, he
would often tell, and with no little pride
in his voice&mdash;&#8220;worked for it thirty-two
years, come Lammas; and that wus a
very long while.&#8221;
</p>
<p>To Bill, and the few remaining, or still
discoverable, like him, the firm&#8217;s credit
was his; and the firm should never find
its confidence misplaced so long as Bill
Withers could walk on his two feet, or
aid some suffering creature. Those were
his sentiments. Then, of course, this Bill
had a soft place in his heart for animals
generally, though the softest place of all
was unreservedly retained for dogs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They wus human; well, a sight better
than human, as any one might see humans
at times&#8221;;&mdash;that was the way he
put it. &#8220;And there warn&#8217;t a mossel o&#8217;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
doubt about it, no matter what nobody
said.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At that, his mates in the yard thought
well to let the matter drop.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That there Bill has his queer hideas
abaht most things; better leave him to
hisself,&#8221; they remarked, with a twist of
the mouth, and passed on.
</p>
<p>Bill had a habit of speaking his
thoughts aloud, especially when up at
night. He found company in the habit,
and was employing his time in this way
now.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Two o&#8217;clock. Another half-hour and
he&#8217;ll have to have the soup, and then a
little stim&#8217;lant. That wus the orders.
Let&#8217;s see. To-morrow&#8217;s Toosday. That&#8217;ll
make it three weeks since the master
brought un back with him in his motor,
all wrapped in blankets. &#8217;Twas that ogg-sigen
as saved him at the moment. But
here&mdash;he&#8217;s been fed every two hours,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
night and day since, any way. Well,
well....&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a step on the cobbles of the
yard. Bill looked round. &#8220;Mr. Charles&#8221;&mdash;as
he called him&mdash;the head of the firm,
was coming.
</p>
<p>Five weeks before this Murphy had
been taken ill. Nobody appeared to
know what was the matter with him, except
that he was restless, refused his food,
and looked wrong in his coat. The very
spirit there was in him misled others: he
would hunt birds under the smallest
provocation; rabbits were not animals to
be given up so long as there was breath
in the body; that finest of games, working
to the hand, was to be played to the
last day, for was it not the jolliest of fun
for both, and did not his master laugh
loudly when it was all over, and he
skipped and barked and jumped himself,
asking for just one more turn? It was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
only the chicken-hearted that gave up;
life was to be lived to the very last minute,
especially when so full of fun and
happiness as his. If he flagged and was
tired after these doings, it was only the
hot weather: he would be all right tomorrow.
So he was kept quiet for a
week.
</p>
<p>But the morrow came, and he was less
full of life than on the day before. There
was something evidently wrong; though
advice was asked, and with little gain.
His bright eyes had grown dull now, and
he refused all food. It was time to call
in the best opinion that could be had.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Distemper. Pneumonia; and the
heart also affected.&#8221; That was the verdict.
There was just a chance for him.
It would be a risk to move him so far;
but it was perhaps worth it, as treatment
could then be followed properly: in
establishments of the kind all animals were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
tended with as much care and skill as
patients in a hospital.
</p>
<p>So Murphy was taken away. How
suddenly it had all come about. And
now three weeks had gone by; and the
dog still lived.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s he doing, Bill?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No difference to my mind, as I can
see.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We must save him, if we can, Bill.
She was here again to-day, and said the
dog was such a very valuable one that she
didn&#8217;t know what would happen if he
died.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I judged something of the kind,&#8221; remarked
Bill. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a cousin, over
their way: shepherd to Mr. Phipps&mdash;him
as has Fair Mile Farm. You knows. He
come in with him&mdash;&#8217;twus last Saturday&#8217;s
market&mdash;over some tegs; and he called
in here, and I do believes &#8217;twus to ask
how this un here wus. Said he&#8217;d allus
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
liked un. Seemed to know all about un.
Said as he and the gen&#8217;leman as owns un
wus allus together; that he couldn&#8217;t get
about like some; and that he and this dog
here was never apart, and seemed to hang
together, curious ways like. They&#8217;d got
some name for the two of &#8217;em down in
that part&mdash;so he says; but I a&#8217;most forgets
what &#8217;twus now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So I understand. One or two have
been to call to ask after him, up at the
office, and said much the same.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Been here himself, hasn&#8217;t he?&#8221; inquired
Bill.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, yesterday. I told him he couldn&#8217;t
see him; or, rather, that if he did, with
the dog&#8217;s heart as rocky as it was, I would
not answer for the result. He did not
speak a word after that, except&mdash;&#8216;Do
your best&#8217;; and went out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;From what that cousin o&#8217; mine said,&#8221;
put in Bill, &#8220;I judge if he&#8217;d come in, it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
would a-killed the dog right off.&#8221;
He was smoothing Murphy&#8217;s ears as he
spoke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I told him,&#8221; continued Mr. Charles,
&#8220;that two things were especially against
this dog; one was his high breeding,
and the other, his brain development.
It&#8217;s the last I&#8217;m most afraid of,
though.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Brain? Clever?&#8221; put in Bill&mdash;&#8220;I
should just say he <i>was</i>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&mdash;And I told him that I had never
seen a dog that was easier to treat; and
that he was making a real plucky fight
for it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; said Bill, in a tone as if
the words had been &#8220;Amen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&mdash;And that he was that sensible that
he allowed us to do just as we liked with
him; so good and patient that there was
not a man in the yard that wasn&#8217;t <i>glad</i> to
do anything for him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></p>
<p>&#8220;True again,&#8221; broke in Bill, with emphasis.&mdash;&#8220;Murphy,&#8221;
he said, calling the
dog by name. &#8220;Whew! Another hot
day, I judge; coming light afore long.&#8221;
Bill was looking at the sky.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All against him; all against him,&#8221; returned
the other. &#8220;But there, I shall be
downright sorry if we lose him now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bill shook his head. &#8220;See all as has
been done ... and the telegrams ... and
the letters, and ...&#8221;
</p>
<p>The conversation of the two men was
stopped by a low bark from the dog.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dreaming,&#8221; said Bill; &#8220;does a lot o&#8217;
sleep.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Brain,&#8221; said the other, listening&mdash;&#8220;I
feared as much all along. It&#8217;s all up,
Bill.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bill was down, and had got one of his
hands under the dog&#8217;s head.
</p>
<p>The bark came again: only a very weak
one; not enough to disturb anybody near.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
It became continuous after that; grew a
little louder; then gradually fainter.
</p>
<p>Perhaps he was hunting birds, though
it may be doubted. More likely he was
working to the hand over the sunlit fields,
in the glad air, with a full life all before
him yet; and in the company of one
whom he loved with his whole heart, and
to whom, while learning constantly himself,
he, a dog, had taught no end of
things.
</p>
<p>There can be little doubt that he was
working by the hand. Of course he was.
But the hand that was beckoning him
now was from over the border&mdash;from the
land where there is room for both the
man and the dog, and where there shall
be a blessed reunion with old friends.
</p>
<p>The bark died away: Murphy was
dead.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not five years; or only just,&#8221; remarked
Bill.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></p>
<p>Both men heaved a sigh.
</p>
<p>Day was breaking as they walked away
together down the yard.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>A few days later came this, written by
one whose business it was to tend the sick
and the suffering among animals; to
whom their passing was no rare event;
and who must have had many thousands
through his hands:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am so very sorry; but it was really
a happy release after the brain symptoms
had developed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can only say your dog won the affection
of all of us here to an extent unequalled
by any other patient. I think
this was due to the very brave way that
he bore his sufferings, his kind and amenable
temperament, and his almost human
intelligence. There is no doubt that this
last increased the susceptibility of his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
brain to disease, and made recovery
hopeless.&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Two men were working their way
slowly up the Dene. They were the
shepherd, Job Nutt, and his second. And
their dogs followed them closely to heel.
</p>
<p>They had just set out a new bait for
the sheep on the vetches lower down, and
were making for home.
</p>
<p>Violet shadows had stretched themselves
out to their furthest over the red
wheat, now rapidly ripening; soon they
would fade out altogether, and the woods
would grow blue. For the sun was touching
the line of the distant hills, and the
long day&#8217;s work was done.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, there goes Him,&#8221; says one,
pointing up at the down to the eastward.
</p>
<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></div>
<p>&#8220;So it be,&#8221; returns the other&mdash;&#8220;Him
and his ... Oh ah! but I was a-most forgettin&#8217;. I allus liked that dog&#8221;; and Job
Nutt waved his hand.

<p>It was only a dog.
</p>
<p>Perhaps so.
</p>
<p>The fact does not forbid the familiar
question that rises always at certain hours
to the mind of man, and will continue to
do so till time shall cease, whether his
friend take human or only canine form in
life:
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin: 0 auto 0 ; '><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;But his spirit&mdash;where does his spirit rest?</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>It was God that made him&mdash;God knows best.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>In truth, there is no answer to this
question&mdash;&#8220;Whither?&#8221; And thus it is
that we are compelled to leave it according
to our habit when we are at fault, and
much as the poet leaves it here. In the
case of the man, we think we understand.
In that of the dog, our difficulty appears
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
to defy solution: it is no question of argument,
assertions are idle, dogma has no
place. On the one hand we have those
principles that come to man&#8217;s aid, but of
which it would be unbecoming now to
speak. The vast majority of Christian
men are enabled to ride out the storms
of life without confidence wholly giving
way, and with the first of sheet-anchors
fixed in what is felt to be the best of
holding ground. When, however, we
turn to the possible future status of the
dog, there is no sheet-anchor, and the
holding ground is indifferent. Yet, in
considering the case of the man and the
dog, we are not left without a certain
measure of support equally applicable to
both. The spirit definable as the immediate
apprehension of the mind without
reasoning&mdash;the spirit of intuition&mdash;aids
us on either hand. &#8220;We are endued,&#8221; as
Bishop Butler tells us, &#8220;with capacities
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
of perception&#8221;; and these enable us to
accept much that lies outside the actual
region of proof, because our inner consciousness
tells us that we are not altogether
on a false track, and that truths, if
half hidden, yet, of a certainty, exist in
the direction in which we are making
earnest search.
</p>
<p>We necessarily suffer here, as always,
from the tendency that makes the wish
the father to the thought; or, in other
words, we not infrequently shovel the
unpalatable overboard, that we may lighten
the ship, and ride out this or that squall
without quite so much strain upon the
sheet-anchor aforesaid. The majority of
mankind believe, and will continue to
believe, most staunchly in what they wish
to believe. Yet this tendency on our part&mdash;visible
as it often is in directions where
we should least expect to find it&mdash;does not
necessarily prove our beliefs false, while
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
it also leads us not infrequently direct to
truths, however unorthodox our course
may have appeared to lookers-on.
</p>
<p>In considering, then, the question of
the possible future existence of our canine
friends, the dominant feeling is
commonly this: We believe that a future,
in great probability, exists for them,
because we feel that not to believe this
would be to turn the whole scheme of the
universe, as we understand it, into one
little short of nonsense. We do not stop
to reason: such things are because they
must be; they cannot cease to be without
total disfigurement of the plan of our
conception. Intuition points, and almost
impulsively perhaps, in one direction.
There is &#8220;an intelligent Author of Nature
or Natural Governor of the world.&#8221; Life
is not made up of haphazards. Eventually
there will be happiness in completest
form: otherwise there would be injustice,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
and of this, life, as we know it,
affords little or no evidence. For happiness
to be complete, there can be no question
of the songs we are to hear being indifferently
harmonised, there can be no
rifts in the lute: in a state of perfection
imperfections must necessarily be imperceptible.
</p>
<p>With our narrow, human limitations
we are driven to conclusions naturally
circumscribed and coloured by those limitations.
We are cognisant of the narrowness
of the field of vision allowed us,
and we are perpetually made aware that
we are beating our wings against the bars;
but we nevertheless accept this or that
conclusion because it satisfies our souls,
or we refuse to accept it because we cannot
honestly confess that it does so. Yet,
once again, behind both acceptance and
rejection there is something further&mdash;that
intuition and power of perception
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
that enable us to find satisfaction in inferences
that we know lie outside questions
of faith, but which we nevertheless
feel to be true. And the very fact that
we are enabled to derive this satisfaction
and to feel that our conclusions have an
element of truth in them tends to confirm
us, rightly or wrongly, in our conjectures.
</p>
<p>Thus we come deliberately to the opinion
that dogs will have a place in the
land over the border. Such an opinion
may be a bold one; but there is reason
for believing that it is somewhat widely
held. We naturally tend to materialise
when we build up our several pictures;
but we sin here, if at all, in the best of
company. The city that lay foursquare,
and that is described to us in the vision
in the Island of Patmos, was of pure gold,
with walls of jasper and gates of precious
stones, and had within it trees and birds
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
and many divers animals, and material
things of greatest beauty, besides the figures
of innumerable angels. The description
could not have been otherwise drawn
if it was to be grasped by the mind of
man, even to a limited extent. So with
ourselves. To conceive of a world with
all the attributes of beauty yet without
flowers is impossible. To realise a world
full of music and song yet without birds
may be possible, but transcends the powers
of most minds. To attempt to believe
in the happiness of a world where
companionship is to be looked for and
reunion is promised, yet where the
companionship of dogs is denied, is to strain
the belief of some to the uttermost and
not improbably to fail.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor,&#8221; writes Bishop Butler in his immortal
treatise, &#8220;can we find anything
throughout the whole analogy of nature
to afford us even the slightest presumption
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
that animals ever lose their living
powers; much less, if it were possible,
that they lose them by death: for we have
no faculties wherewith to trace any beyond
or through it, so as to see what becomes
of them. This event removes them
from our view. It destroys the sensible
proof, which we had before death, of
their being possessed of living powers,
but does not appear to afford the least
reason to believe that they are, then, or
by that event, deprived of them. And
our knowing that they were possessed of
these powers, up to the very period to
which we have faculties capable of tracing
them, is itself a probability of their
retaining them beyond it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When Robert Southey looked for the
last time on his old friend, Phillis&mdash;and
there is a bitter difference on such an occasion
between looking upon the young
and the old&mdash;he tells how often in his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
earlier days this dog and he had enjoyed
childish sports together, and how, later
on, when hard times overtook him, he
found delight in recalling the faithful
fondness of the friend in the distant
home, and longed to feel again the
warmth of his dumb welcome. Then,
when the old dog is at last dead, and
there has come a severance of these precious
associations, he breaks out with:

<p>When we turn to the first of all books,
the dog certainly appears to receive harsh
treatment. The term &#8220;dog&#8221; is invariably
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
one of reproach. Goliath cursing David
asks, &#8220;Am I a dog?&#8221; Abner exclaims,
&#8220;Am I a dog&#8217;s head?&#8221; St. Paul refers to
false prophets as dogs. In the Psalms the
dog is found to be synonymous with the
devil; in the Gospels it stands for unholy
men. Evil-workers are dogs; a dog is the
equivalent of a fool; nothing is lower
than a dog, and nothing is to be more abhorred.
Finally, there is that hardest
sentence of all&mdash;&#8220;Without are dogs&#8221;; as
though any hope for dogs was entirely
forbidden. It is the same throughout:
the depraved of mankind are dogs, and
the very acme of possible reproach and
contempt is apparently to be found in
the use of this one term. Abandon hope;&mdash;without,
are you who are dogs!
</p>
<p>But is the use of this term &#8220;dog&#8221; to be
taken literally? There seems to be ample
evidence that it should not be. The very
extravagance of the language raises a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
doubt at once, just as the grotesqueness
of the application of the term shows that
the dog itself could never have been
meant. St. Paul speaks of false prophets
as dogs because of their impudence and
love of gain&mdash;characteristics hardly to be
attributed to the animal itself. The term
&#8220;dead dog&#8221; was the most opprobrious to
which a Jew could lay his tongue; when
David endeavoured to convey to the mind
of Saul that the persecution to which he
was subjecting him was a dishonour to
himself, he asked him whom he was pursuing;
was he pursuing &#8220;after a dead
dog&#8221;? If, as Horace has it, &#8220;death is the
utmost boundary of wealth and power,&#8221;
it is surely no less so of pursuit.
</p>
<p>Then again, in the Psalms, David
writes, &#8220;Deliver my soul from the sword,
my darling from the power of the dog&#8221;;
in other words, the devil. All dogs are
not good dogs, though all dogs are good
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
dogs to their respective owners; but no
dog can possibly be classed as we find him
here, or as the very image and likeness of
the most depraved and debased of mankind
as we find him elsewhere. He is incapable
of these sins; he does not fall into
these errors.
</p>
<p>What we have to remember is apparently
this. The earliest mention of the
dog in Scripture is in connection with the
sojourn of the Israelites in Egypt. The
dog was declared by the Jewish law to
be unclean; and it is not improbable that
the Jews were so taught to regard him in
opposition to those taskmasters who, they
were well aware, held him sacred. Thus
the term dogs appears often as the reflection
of a passionate and deep-seated
hatred, apart altogether from the animal&#8217;s
uncleanness, and also from the
animal itself. The word came in this
way to be a useful one to hurl at the head
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
of an enemy at all times, or by which to
classify those who lived outside the pale
of common, human decency. For such
as these last there could be no hope, and
the term as applied to them was judged
to carry with it the bitterest stigma, just
as it continues to do in the East to the
present day. To be a Christian is to be
a dog; to be a Jew is to be a dog; an infidel
is a dog; and to be known as &#8220;a
Jew&#8217;s dog,&#8221; or &#8220;a dead dog,&#8221; is to have
sunk to the lowest depths of depravity in
the eyes of all men.
</p>
<p>But the way in which dogs were regarded
did not stop with Jewish edicts
and Jewish opinion. When the ancient
Egyptians made way for another type,
and Moslems took their place, the dog,
honoured before as has been shown, fell
at once into an inferior position. The
Moslem law took its colour largely from
Jewish practice, and the dog was generally
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
looked upon by the Mahomedan as
unclean. He continues, as all the world
knows, to be still so regarded. The dog,
in the East, is at once tolerated and neglected:
he may be slightly better than
the pig, but, like that wholly unclean animal,
he is a scavenger, living largely on
offal and what he is able to pick up.
</p>
<p>He is thus, for the most part, a poor
creature, leading a poor life, and being
often much to be pitied. That he should
have any future prospects before him,
seeing him as he is, might well be
doubted. But this must also be remembered,
that if he is in various stages of
development in these far-off lands, and
with little chance of betterment, he does
not differ greatly in these respects from
vast multitudes of men among whom he
moves, whether they be white, yellow,
brown, or black. The conditions of his
life are little by which to condemn him,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
just as they would be insufficient in the
case of others. Moreover, all classes certainly
do not so condemn him, or do they
look upon him in quite the same light.
By the Parsees, for instance, he is not
regarded as wholly unclean. Many of
them keep English-bred dogs, as also do
some of the more Europeanised natives
of other classes, treating them much as
we do, though this is still uncommon.
Hindus of good class and Mahomedans
are found generally to avoid them; but
here again many Hindus, and such a caste
as Sweepers, will touch a dog without
considering themselves defiled, just as a
Mahomedan will often hold or take
charge of a dog, though he be careful not
to do so by the chain, or leather lead, but
by slipping his <i>jharan</i>, or cloth, through
the dog&#8217;s collar, and handling him that
way. In many Mahomedan villages the
dog is found in numbers, the inhabitants
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
being glad of his services in shepherding
their goats, though condemning him to
live outside the house, even though there
be likelihood of his being carried off by
a prowling leopard.
</p>
<p>In certain directions, therefore, the dog
is seen to be at least tolerated. But there
remains one other remarkable fact to be
noted. No one can have travelled in the
East, especially in Turkey, without remarking
the way in which the dog is
generally regarded. Yet, in spite of this,
he is all the while certainly classed as
supernatural, and by no less an authority
than the Koran. His uncleanness must
be recognised; but, on the other hand,
how are his fidelity and courage to be
overlooked? They cannot be. And so
this unclean animal, from whom men
shrink, lest by chance their garments
touch him as they pass, is given, as already
related, a position in Mahomed&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
paradise, and, because of his character, is
deemed worthy a special place in that
land of supreme bliss. There is a chance,
then, for the outcast here.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>It is time to look at the dog himself a
little closer, and see what characteristics
he can bring forward in support of hopes
that many human beings entertain on his
behalf.
</p>
<p>Here is a dumb animal that, long before
the dawn of history, is known to
have been man&#8217;s close companion. Step
by step, we see him advancing with those
to whom he is linked, until he raises himself
immeasurably above all other animals,
and takes his place pre-eminently
as the friend of man. No one of those
from whom he originally sprang was
known to bark, and no wild species does
so. By and through man, the dog was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
endowed with this means of expression,
and was thus able to act as his more efficient
guard. It is an established fact
that the dog barks when in contact with
man, and loses the power when separated
from him. Such was the case with the
dogs that were left many years ago on
the uninhabited island of Juan Fernandez.
The descendants of these dogs were
found thirty years later to have lost the
power of barking, and only subsequently
regained it with difficulty.
</p>
<p>The fact that the dog barks is not, however,
the chief point. This peculiar gift
has been developed into a language, for
it is by those wonderful inflections of the
voice in barking that the dog has learnt to
make man understand his meaning.
Thus, as we all know, he is able to convey,
at will, a note of warning, to signal
the approach of danger, to show his anger,
his alarm, his joy, the spirit that animates
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
him in the chase, to make his
appeal for help, to declare the need of
succour. His bark has in these ways become
his chief means of communication,
quite apart from the howl, the whimper,
the whine, or the growl; the &#8220;singing&#8221;
that is associated with a pack of foxhounds
baying at the moon; the &#8220;talk&#8221;
that the subject of these pages possessed
to such an extraordinary degree.
</p>
<p>Then again, as he responded more
readily to education, and acquired by
degrees something of the civilising instincts
that were affecting man, the dog
became not only a trusty companion but
a humble servant. Nor did he stop here,
for, what was still more remarkable, he
certainly came by degrees to reflect some
of man&#8217;s chief characteristics, as well as
nearly all human passions. By association
of ideas he developed memory. By
his dreams and the various sounds he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
emits in sleep, he is seen to possess imagination.
His wonderful power of
scent is found capable of being turned to
other uses than sport, and is even now not
utilised in sundry quarters as it might be.
Then, too, he habitually forms his own
judgments, and these are usually exceedingly
correct, as when he recognises an
intruder, or arrives at what is right and
what is wrong within the circle of his
own domain. On many occasions he certainly
gives evidence of a conscience and
the possession of the rudiments of the
moral sense. When he does wrong he
frequently exhibits shame as well as contrition,
seeking forgiveness, and being
often distinctly unhappy till this is secured.
So far does he occasionally carry
this, that when he knows he has transgressed
rules, he will come and make confession,
his own honesty bringing upon
him a punishment he would otherwise
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
have escaped, or serving to declare what
was not previously suspected by those
about him.
</p>
<p>But it is when we approach the higher
qualities that the dog stands out in his
true light. The best of his class naturally
possess these in greatest perfection,
but it is a fact that none are altogether
without them. His instinct, his patience
and subservience to the will of his master,
his pluck and his courage, his fidelity
that nothing seems capable of undermining,
his trustfulness, his power of sympathy
with man and with his own class,
and, lastly, the touching and infinite
depth of his love&mdash;all these are characteristics
that occasionally put man to
shame, but which make man always trust
him more and more. In the face of his
marvellous instinct, man is not infrequently
struck dumb as he watches. A
dog&#8217;s patience is a thing to study, as well
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
as one from which to learn many a fair
lesson. His pluck and courage are almost
proverbial. In many a case the
odds against him seem not to make the
slightest difference: he will fight on to
the end; let his master only lead, he will
follow to the death.
</p>
<p>And it is here that his fidelity attains
its very pinnacle. Faithful unto death!
Again and again, in innumerable instances,
he has shown his faithfulness long
after the one he loved was dead. The
dog in the mediæval legend that dug his
master&#8217;s grave, covered him with moss
and leaves, and then watched there for
seven years, until he died himself, has
found many a parallel in real life. A
well-known dog in the days of the
Stewarts was still beside his master&#8217;s
tomb three years after the latter&#8217;s death;
and, in much later times, another dog, at
Lisle, refused to come away from the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
spot where his master lay, and remained
on guard for nine long years, the villagers
recognising his fidelity by building him
a kennel and bringing him his daily food
until he died.
</p>
<p>And if an instance of the exhibition of
grief on the part of a dog is called for,
some will remember the little dog in the
far-away Sudan. He was the property of
the only officer that fell at Ginnis, and
who had been in the habit of taking him
everywhere. When his master was consigned
to the sand, this dog was seen to
be cowering beside the stretcher, looking
even smaller than before; and, when all
was over, he had to be lifted away from
the edge of the pit, where he lay with his
head hanging over the edge in an abject
state of grief. He was only a dog, and a
small one; but many a man, hardened by
the experiences of a campaign, turned
away his head at the sight.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></p>
<p>Few can have been much in the company
of dogs without becoming aware of
their power of sympathy, the way in
which they almost invariably show this to
their own kind, and also especially to
man. For a dog to be injured or ill is
for others at least to leave him in peace;
but with man they go much further, as
they do in many directions where man is
concerned. When Lazarus lay at the
gate of Dives, alone and neglected, it was
the dogs that came and licked his sores.
So, too, in the hours of human adversity,
somehow or other, dogs appear to understand,
and act accordingly. How often
the expression is heard&mdash;&#8220;They know!&#8221;
The reason of their conduct and their actions
on such occasions is entirely hidden
from us, just as is that strange sense that
dogs of highly developed brains undoubtedly
possess&mdash;awe of the unknown,
and that has made some conclude that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
they have an inkling of the spirit world.
</p>
<p>Many dogs are subject to fits of nervousness,
though for the most part only in
connection with things they do not understand
or are unable to grasp at the moment.
At such times the dog invariably
seeks the closer company of his friend,
man. On the other hand, the dog often
understands the meaning of sounds when
man is at fault and a feeling of uncertainty
has been aroused. A glance at a
dog, and the words&mdash;&#8220;the dog hasn&#8217;t
moved,&#8221; are quite sufficient then to reassure
the watcher, possibly out of doors
on a dark night. Thus the one looks to
the other for support and confidence, and
a mutual spirit of reliance exists between
both.
</p>
<p>There is little need to say much here
of the dog&#8217;s power of love, for every one
is aware of it, or may have been made
richer by it in his life. The old saying of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
centuries ago still holds good, and &#8220;the
dog is the only animal in creation that
luvs you more than he luvs himself.&#8221;
There are those who assert that all love
is divine in origin. If this be so, and the
dog could be considered to have a religion,
then undoubtedly his religion is
the love of man. We are brought face to
face here with a passion that, in the dog,
knows no limits, and that is apparently
incapable of alienation. Faith, truth,
love! What is to be said;&mdash;whence come
these amazing powers; for what object
could they have been created here? Perhaps
the matter were better left where
that other was just now. We can only
seek the shelter that is common to us in
such circumstances.
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin: 0 auto 0 ; '><tr><td>

<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>Above all human estimate.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Once again, for ourselves, there is no
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
definite answer. The whole question
forms but one more problem added to
an interminable sequence, and in the face
of which the man and the dog are both
dumb.
</p>
<p>Yet when we look back, and ask ourselves,
&#8220;Are all these for naught?&#8221; is it
still man&#8217;s province to be mute? Many
further questions crowd up to the mind
here, as they ever do in yet graver issues.
In our weakness and our anxiety
we cannot suffer our case to go by default,
even though we confess our inability
to answer the questions one by one
as they appear. We can only turn away
our heads and say, &#8220;Such things can <i>not</i>
be.&#8221; This close relationship cannot be
cut off and cease for ever. This touching
interdependence cannot be brought
to a sudden and a final end. The sparrows
cannot be cared for and the dogs
cast out. In other words, living things
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
among animals, not directly associated
with human beings in their lives, cannot,
surely, be singly preserved and those
which have won our love and loved us in
return be lost to us for ever and condemned.
</p>
<p>Is it possible that all these marvellous
qualities and characteristics, gathered together
into one dumb animal, are to pass
away and to have no place in the larger
circuit of life? Are all these consolations
that this animal, and this animal alone
among the so-called dumb, is capable of
bringing&mdash;are all the influences for good
that he is granted the power of exercising
upon the mind, the spirit, and the very
soul of man&mdash;to be accounted of no
worth; to be merely so many items to be
used up in the furtherance of a great
scheme and plan; to be dissipated even as
the mists of the dawn when the day shall
at last break? Surely,&mdash;can such things
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
be? Human judgment and human justice
are for ever fallible, and rough expedients
at best. But that other judgment
for which we look, and that other
justice upon which we are wont mentally
to lean, cannot possibly be either one
or the other.
</p>
<p>Something, then, of our case may assuredly
be left there. We cannot answer
the questions; but, as we confront them,
we yet cannot cut ourselves free from
that spirit of intuition spoken of above,
or cease to draw our several inferences.
Continuity in Nature faces us at every
turn. All things work together for the
final perfection of the whole&mdash;for the
final transcendent beauty and completeness
of the whole. There is unity in all.
Of that most are certain; and men walk
therefore in good hope. There is mystery
at every turn. There is no escape
from it. There is ever the demand for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
the making of a good fight in the face of
it. And there is promise of victory in
the end on the part of One
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin: 0 auto 0 ; '><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;Who by low creatures leads to heights of love.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>We are not all willing to accept such
things. We do not all, in our march in
life, require the same tools to win our
way. Neither do we all look in the same
direction&mdash;not for help, merely, but for
those common daily aids that we gather,
or that are gatherable, from the simple
and the great, from the animate and the
inanimate, from the stained as from the
beautiful and the pure.
</p>
<p>In writing of the death of an animal
second only to the dog, Whyte-Melville
asks this:
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin: 0 auto 0 ; '><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;There are men both good and wise who hold that, in a future state,</p>

<p>It may be folly. Yet the writer of

in the quiet corner of the beautiful
home, when Murphy was laid to rest
close by Dan, these words were cut upon
his headstone, in faith and in good hope:
